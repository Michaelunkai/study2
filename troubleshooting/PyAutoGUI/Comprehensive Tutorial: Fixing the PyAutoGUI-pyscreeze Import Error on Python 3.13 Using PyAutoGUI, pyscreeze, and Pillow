# Comprehensive Tutorial: Fixing the PyAutoGUI-pyscreeze Import Error on Python 3.13 Using PyAutoGUI, pyscreeze, and Pillow

This tutorial explains step-by-step how to resolve the error:
> *"PyAutoGUI was unable to import pyscreeze. (This is likely because you're running a version of Python that Pillow (which pyscreeze depends on) doesn't support currently.) Please install this module to enable the function you tried to call."*

We’ll cover everything from verifying your installations to upgrading or downgrading the necessary packages and Python version.

## Step 1: Understand the Problem

When running a PyAutoGUI script to take a screenshot, the error occurs because:
- **pyscreeze** depends on **Pillow**.
- The installed version of Pillow may not support Python 3.13, leading to a compatibility issue.

## Step 2: Verify Your Environment

Before making changes, ensure you’re using the correct Python version and package installations.

1. **Check your Python version:**
   ```powershell
   py --version
   ```
2. **List installed packages:**
   ```powershell
   py -m pip list
   ```

Look for:
- **pyautogui**
- **pyscreeze**
- **Pillow**

## Step 3: Option 1 – Upgrade Pillow to a Pre-release Version

If you want to continue using Python 3.13, try upgrading Pillow to a version that might support it.

1. Open your PowerShell and run:
   ```powershell
   py -m pip install --upgrade --pre Pillow
   ```
2. Confirm the Pillow version:
   ```powershell
   py -m pip show Pillow
   ```
3. Run your PyAutoGUI script again:
   ```powershell
   py a.py
   ```
   
If the error is resolved, you’re set! If not, proceed to Option 2.

## Step 4: Option 2 – Downgrade Your Python Version

If no compatible Pillow version is available for Python 3.13, consider using an earlier Python version (e.g., Python 3.11).

1. **Download Python 3.11:**
   - Visit the [Python Downloads Page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download Python 3.11.
2. **Install Python 3.11:**
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
3. **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
   ```powershell
   py -3.11 -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```
4. **Reinstall Your Packages:**
   ```powershell
   pip install pyautogui pyscreeze Pillow
   ```
5. **Run Your Script Again:**
   ```powershell
   py a.py
   ```

## Step 5: Verify the Fix

After following either option:
- Run your script.
- Confirm that the screenshot function works without raising the pyscreeze error.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can resolve the PyAutoGUI-pyscreeze import error caused by an incompatible version of Pillow in Python 3.13. Either upgrading Pillow to a pre-release version or downgrading to a supported Python version should eliminate the issue. Happy coding!
