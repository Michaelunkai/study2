**Fixing the "AttributeError: module 'PIL.Image' has no attribute 'ANTIALIAS'" Error when Installing TensorFlow and TFlearn**

In this tutorial, we will walk through the steps to install TensorFlow and TFlearn, and fix the "AttributeError: module 'PIL.Image' has no attribute 'ANTIALIAS'" error that may occur during the installation process.

**Step 1: Create a New Virtual Environment**

First, we need to create a new virtual environment using Python. Open a terminal and run the following command:

  
python -m venv myenv

**Step 2: Activate the Virtual Environment**

Next, we need to activate the virtual environment. Run the following command:

  
source myenv/bin/activate

**Step 3: Install TensorFlow**

Now, we can install TensorFlow using pip. However, we need to install a specific version of TensorFlow that is compatible with TFlearn. Run the following command:

  
pip install tensorflow==2.10.0

**Step 4: Install TFlearn**

After installing TensorFlow, we can install TFlearn. However, we need to downgrade Pillow to a version that is compatible with TFlearn. Run the following commands:

  
pip install Pillow==9.0.1
pip install tflearn

**Step 5: Install NLTK**

If you are using NLTK in your script, you need to install it separately. Run the following command:

  
pip install nltk

**Step 6: Run Your Script**

Finally, you can run your script using the following command:

  
  a.py

This should resolve the "AttributeError: module 'PIL.Image' has no attribute 'ANTIALIAS'" error and allow you to run your script without errors.

**Full Code:**

Here is the full code for the tutorial:
  
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
pip install tensorflow==2.10.0
pip install Pillow==9.0.1
pip install tflearn
pip install nltk
  a.py

**Trouble ooting:**

If you are still experiencing issues, you can try the following:

* Check the version of TensorFlow and TFlearn that you are using.
* Make sure that you have downgraded Pillow to a version that is compatible with TFlearn.
* Try reinstalling TensorFlow and TFlearn.
* Check the documentation for TensorFlow and TFlearn for any known issues or compatibility problems.
