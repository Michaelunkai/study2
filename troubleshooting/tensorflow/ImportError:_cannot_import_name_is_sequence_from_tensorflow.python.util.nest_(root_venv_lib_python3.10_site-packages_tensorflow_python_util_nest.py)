The issue here is that the tflearn library is not compatible with the latest version of TensorFlow (2.17.0) that you have installed. The error message specifically indicates that the is_sequence function has been removed from tensorflow.python.util.nest.

To fix this issue, you can try downgrading TensorFlow to a version that is compatible with tflearn. You can do this by running the following command:


pip install tensorflow==2.10.0
Alternatively, you can try upgrading tflearn to the latest version, but this may not work if the latest version of tflearn is not compatible with the latest version of TensorFlow.


pip install --upgrade tflearn
If you are still experiencing issues, you may need to consider using a different library that is compatible with the latest version of TensorFlow.

Also, note that the tflearn library has not been maintained for a while, and the last update was in 2020. You may want to consider using a more actively maintained library, such as Keras or TensorFlow itself.

Here are the general steps you can follow:

Create a new virtual environment:

python -m venv myenv
Activate the virtual environment:

source myenv/bin/activate
Install the required packages:

pip install tensorflow==2.10.0 tflearn
Run your script:

  a.py
This should resolve the compatibility issue and allow you to run your script without errors.
