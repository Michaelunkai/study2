### Step 3: Rebuild `dpkg` File Database to Fix "dpkg: warning: files list file for package '<package>' missing; assuming package has no files currently installed"

Run the following single one-liner to rebuild the `dpkg` file database and reinstall all installed packages:

  
sudo mv /var/lib/dpkg/info /var/lib/dpkg/info_old && sudo mkdir /var/lib/dpkg/info && sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get install --reinstall -y $(dpkg -l | grep ^ii | awk '{print $2}')

This command does the following:
1. Moves the potentially corrupted `dpkg` package info directory to a backup.
2. Creates a new, empty `info` directory for `dpkg`.
3. Updates the package list.
4. Reinstalls all previously installed packages to rebuild the database.
