### Tutorial: "How to Resolve Docker Certificate Error by Setting System Date and Time Correctly Using `timedatectl` on Ubuntu Linux"

This tutorial will guide you through resolving the Docker certificate validation error by adjusting the system date and time using the `timedatectl` command on an Ubuntu Linux system.

#### Step 1: Disable Automatic Time Synchronization
First, you need to disable automatic time synchronization to set the system time manually.

  
sudo timedatectl set-ntp false

#### Step 2: Set the Correct Date and Time
Once NTP (Network Time Protocol) is disabled, manually set the system date and time to the desired value. In this case, set the date to `07/10/2024` and time to `21:04`.

  
sudo timedatectl set-time '2024-10-07 21:04:00'

#### Step 3: Enable Automatic Time Synchronization Again (Optional)
If you want your system to automatically synchronize with the correct time from an NTP server, you can re-enable automatic time synchronization.

  
sudo timedatectl set-ntp true

After completing these steps, retry your Docker command to verify that the certificate error is resolved.
