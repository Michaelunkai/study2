You can fix the `QStandardPaths: wrong permissions on runtime directory /run/user/0/, 0755 instead of 0700` error by changing the permissions of the `/run/user/0/` directory to `0700`. Run the following command:

```bash
sudo chmod 0700 /run/user/0/
```

If the issue persists after rebooting, you may need to modify the PAM configuration to ensure the directory is created with the correct permissions. Try the following:

1. Edit the PAM systemd configuration file:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/pam.d/systemd-user
   ```
   
2. Ensure the following line is present:
   ```plaintext
   session optional pam_systemd.so
   ```

3. Save the file (Ctrl + X, then Y, then Enter).

4. Restart your system:
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

If youâ€™re still experiencing issues, let me know what context you're running this command in (e.g., running a Qt application, logging in as root, etc.), and I can provide more targeted troubleshooting.
