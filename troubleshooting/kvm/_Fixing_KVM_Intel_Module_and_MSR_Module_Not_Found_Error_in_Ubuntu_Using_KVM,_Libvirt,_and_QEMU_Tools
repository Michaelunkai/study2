# Complete Step-by-Step Troubleshooting Guide for Fixing KVM Intel Module and MSR Module Not Found Error in Ubuntu Using KVM, Libvirt, and QEMU Tools

## Errors:
- "INFO: /dev/kvm does not exist"
- "FATAL: Module msr not found in directory /lib/modules"

This tutorial covers step-by-step instructions to install and configure KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine), resolve the issues with the KVM Intel module and MSR module, and troubleshoot errors like `/dev/kvm does not exist` and `FATAL: Module msr not found in directory /lib/modules`. This guide includes the use of **KVM**, **Libvirt**, and **QEMU** tools for virtualization on **Ubuntu**.

---

### Step 1: Install Necessary KVM and Libvirt Packages

  
sudo apt install -y qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon-system libvirt-clients bridge-utils virt-manager

These packages are essential for setting up KVM on Ubuntu. `qemu-kvm` is the KVM virtualization package, while `libvirt-daemon-system` and `libvirt-clients` handle the management of virtual machines.

---

### Step 2: Add Your User to the `libvirt` and `kvm` Groups

To give the current user the necessary permissions to manage virtual machines, run:

  
sudo usermod -aG libvirt,kvm $(whoami)

This command ensures that your user account has access to KVM and Libvirt services.

---

### Step 3: Enable and Start the `libvirtd` Service

  
sudo systemctl enable --now libvirtd

This command enables the `libvirtd` service to start automatically and also starts it immediately.

---

### Step 4: Load the `kvm_intel` Module Manually

To manually load the KVM Intel module, execute the following command:

  
sudo modprobe kvm_intel

If this module isn't loaded, virtualization won't work for Intel CPUs. This step is critical for Intel-based systems.

---

### Step 5: Ensure the `kvm_intel` Module Loads Automatically at Boot

You need to ensure that the `kvm_intel` module loads every time the system reboots. Follow these steps:

1. Open the `/etc/modules` file for editing:
     
   sudo nano /etc/modules

2. Add the following line at the end of the file to ensure the module loads at boot:
     
   kvm_intel

3. Save and exit the file (`CTRL + X`, then `Y`, and `Enter`).

---

### Step 6: Check if the `kvm_intel` Module is Loaded

Run the following command to verify if the `kvm_intel` module is loaded properly:

  
lsmod | grep kvm_intel

This command lists all loaded modules and ensures that `kvm_intel` is among them.

---

### Step 7: Fix the Error: "INFO: /dev/kvm does not exist" and "FATAL: Module msr not found"

If you encounter the error `INFO: /dev/kvm does not exist` or `FATAL: Module msr not found`, follow these steps to resolve it:

1. Install the `msr-tools` package:
     
   sudo apt install msr-tools

   This installs the tools necessary to manage the `msr` (Model-Specific Registers) required for KVM.

2. Manually load the `msr` module:
     
   sudo modprobe msr

   This will load the missing `msr` module, resolving the `FATAL: Module msr not found` error.

3. To ensure that the `msr` module is loaded automatically on every reboot, edit the `/etc/modules` file:

     
   sudo nano /etc/modules

   Add the following line to the file:
     
   msr

4. Save and exit (`CTRL + X`, then `Y`, and `Enter`).

---

### Step 8: Verify the KVM Setup

After loading the modules and fixing the errors, verify that KVM is working:

1. Check if KVM is available by running:
     
   sudo kvm-ok

   This command checks if your CPU supports virtualization and if KVM is configured correctly.

2. If everything is set up correctly, reboot the system to apply all changes:
     
   sudo reboot

---

### Step 9: Verify After Reboot

After rebooting, verify that everything is working as expected:

1. Check if `/dev/kvm` exists, indicating that KVM is working:
     
   ls /dev/kvm

2. Run the `golemsp status` command to check the status of your service and confirm that KVM is functioning properly:
     
   golemsp status

---

### Conclusion

Following these steps should resolve the issues related to KVM, the KVM Intel module, and the MSR module, ensuring that your virtualization environment is properly configured and operational. This guide covered the troubleshooting of common errors such as `/dev/kvm does not exist` and `FATAL: Module msr not found in directory /lib/modules` using KVM, Libvirt, and QEMU tools on Ubuntu.
