### Troubleshooting Guide for Resolving Git Push Errors Due to Secrets, Fixing Commit History, and Successfully Pushing to GitHub Repository in Ubuntu

This guide covers the full steps to resolve Git push errors caused by secrets being detected in commit history, remove sensitive information from a repository, and successfully push the changes to GitHub.

#### Step 1: Install `git-filter-repo` to Remove Sensitive Data from Git History

Start by installing `git-filter-repo`, a tool that allows removing specific paths or files from Git commit history.

  
sudo apt install git-filter-repo

#### Step 2: Remove the Sensitive Data from `.bashrc`

Open the `.bashrc` file and remove the lines containing sensitive data such as your personal access token.

  
nano Shells/ /. rc

Delete the lines (603 and 604 in this case) that contain sensitive information like your GitHub token.

#### Step 3: Rewriting the Git History to Remove Secrets Using `git-filter-repo`

Now, remove the sensitive information from the commit history using `git-filter-repo`. You will remove all history related to the `.bashrc` file.

  
git filter-repo --path Shells/bash/.bashrc --invert-paths --force

This will rewrite the Git history and remove the `.bashrc` file from all commits.

#### Step 4: Re-add the GitHub Remote Repository

Since the remote is missing, you need to re-add the remote repository to your local Git repository. Replace `<your-repo-url>` with the actual GitHub repository URL.

  
git remote add origin https://github.com/Michaelunkai/study2.git

#### Step 5: Verify the Remote Repository

Ensure that the remote repository has been added correctly by checking the remotes configured.

  
git remote -v

This should show your remote repository URL for both `fetch` and `push`.

#### Step 6: Force Push the Changes to GitHub

Now that youâ€™ve successfully removed sensitive data from your history, you can force push your changes to the GitHub repository. Use the `--force` flag to ensure the rewritten history is pushed.

  
git push origin main --force

This command will update your GitHub repository with the corrected commit history, and the sensitive information will no longer be present.

#### Final Verification:

After performing these steps, visit your GitHub repository to ensure the push was successful and that the sensitive data has been removed from the commit history.

This concludes the troubleshooting guide for resolving Git push errors related to secrets and successfully pushing to GitHub.
