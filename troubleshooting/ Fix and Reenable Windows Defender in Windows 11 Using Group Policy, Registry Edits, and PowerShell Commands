This guide provides a step-by-step tutorial to fix, reset, and reenable **Windows Defender** in **Windows 11** using tools such as **Group Policy Editor**, **Registry Editor**, and **PowerShell Commands**.

## **Step 1: Restart Your Computer**
After running any scripts or making changes to your system, always restart your computer first. Many services and registry changes only take effect after a reboot. If the issue persists after restarting, proceed with the following steps.

---

## **Step 2: Verify and Reenable Windows Defender Services**
Windows Defender relies on specific services that must be running for it to function properly.

### **Tools Used: `services.msc`**
1. Press `Win + R`, type `services.msc`, and press Enter.
2. Locate the following services:
   - **Windows Defender Antivirus Service** (Service name: `WinDefend`)
   - **Windows Security Center Service** (Service name: `wscsvc`)
3. Perform these actions for each service:
   - Right-click the service > Select **Properties**.
   - Set **Startup type** to **Automatic**.
   - Click **Start** if the service is not already running.
4. Click **Apply**, then **OK**.

## **Step 3: Remove Group Policy Restrictions**
If Windows Defender has been disabled through Group Policy, these restrictions must be removed.

### **Tools Used: Group Policy Editor (`gpedit.msc`)**
1. Press `Win + R`, type `gpedit.msc`, and press Enter.
2. Navigate to:
   ```
   Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Microsoft Defender Antivirus
   ```
3. Double-click on **Turn off Microsoft Defender Antivirus**.
   - Set it to **Disabled** or **Not Configured**.
   - Click **Apply** and **OK**.

4. Navigate to:
   ```
   Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Microsoft Defender Security Center
   ```
5. Ensure all sub-settings (e.g., notifications, security health) are set to **Not Configured**.

6. Restart your computer to apply the changes.

## **Step 4: Reset Registry Settings**
Windows Defender can also be disabled via registry keys. Resetting these keys can resolve the issue.

### **Tools Used: Registry Editor (`regedit`)**
1. Press `Win + R`, type `regedit`, and press Enter.
2. Navigate to:
   ```
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender
   ```
3. Perform the following:
   - If the key **DisableAntiSpyware** exists, delete it or set its value to `0`.
   - Remove the entire `Windows Defender` key if Defender still fails to start:
     - Right-click on the `Windows Defender` key > Select **Delete**.

4. Check for additional policies in:
   ```
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender Security Center
   ```
   - If any keys exist under this path, delete them.

5. Restart your computer to apply changes.

## **Step 5: Repair Windows Defender Using PowerShell**
If the above steps do not resolve the issue, use PowerShell commands to reset Defender and its components.

### **Tools Used: PowerShell (Run as Administrator)**
1. Open PowerShell as Administrator by searching for "PowerShell" in the Start Menu, right-clicking it, and selecting **Run as Administrator**.
2. Run the following commands one by one:

   **Reset Defender preferences:**
   ```powershell
   Remove-MpPreference -Force
   Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $false
   ```

   **Reinstall Windows Defender components:**
   ```powershell
   Add-AppxPackage -Register -DisableDevelopmentMode `
   -Path "C:\Program Files\Windows Defender\SystemApp\Microsoft.Windows.SecHealthUI_cw5n1h2txyewy\AppxManifest.xml"
   ```

   **Perform a quick scan:**
   ```powershell
   Start-MpScan -ScanType QuickScan
   ```

   > **Note:** If you encounter `0x800106ba` errors, Defender’s core components may be corrupted. Follow the next step for repairs.

## **Step 6: Repair System Files Using DISM and SFC**
If Defender still fails to work, your system files may be corrupted. Use the **DISM** and **SFC** tools to repair them.

### **Tools Used: DISM and SFC**
1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator (search for `cmd`, right-click, and select **Run as Administrator**).
2. Run the following commands in sequence:

   **Check for component store corruption:**
   ```cmd
   DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
   ```

   **Scan and repair the component store:**
   ```cmd
   DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
   ```

   **Repair system files:**
   ```cmd
   sfc /scannow
   ```

3. After the scans complete, restart your computer.

## **Step 7: Reset All Windows Security Settings**
If all else fails, resetting the Windows Security app may resolve the issue.

### **Tools Used: PowerShell**
1. Open PowerShell as Administrator.
2. Run the following command:
   ```powershell
   Get-AppxPackage *Microsoft.Windows.SecHealthUI* | Reset-AppxPackage
   ```

3. Restart your computer after running the command.

## **Step 8: Final Step – Verify and Test Windows Defender**
1. Open Windows Security from the Start Menu.
2. Check if all Defender features are working:
   - Virus & Threat Protection
   - Firewall & Network Protection
   - App & Browser Control
3. Perform a test scan to ensure Defender is active.

---

## **Additional Notes**
- If third-party antivirus software is installed, it may disable Defender. Uninstall the third-party antivirus if you want to use Windows Defender.
- If the issue persists, consider performing a **repair installation** of Windows 11 using the Windows Media Creation Tool.
