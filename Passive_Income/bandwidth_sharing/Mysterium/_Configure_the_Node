 Configure the Node
a. Set Pricing and Bandwidth
Youâ€™ll be able to configure:

Price per GB of bandwidth (in MYST tokens).
Bandwidth limits to control how much of your internet connection is shared.
b. Set up the Wallet
Mysterium pays in MYST tokens, so you need to set up a wallet within the node dashboard:

Create or import a wallet (you'll get a MYST address).
Backup your wallet seed phrase securely (important for wallet recovery).
