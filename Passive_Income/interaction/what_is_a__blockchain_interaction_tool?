A **blockchain interaction tool** is software or a library that allows developers and users to interact with a blockchain network. These tools enable various tasks such as:

1. **Connecting to the blockchain**: Establishing communication with blockchain nodes.
2. **Interacting with smart contracts**: Deploying, calling, and reading smart contract data.
3. **Sending and receiving transactions**: Initiating and verifying transactions on the blockchain.
4. **Querying blockchain data**: Retrieving data such as account balances, block details, and transaction history.

These tools provide the necessary functionality for building decentralized applications (dApps), managing assets, and interacting with blockchain networks programmatically.
