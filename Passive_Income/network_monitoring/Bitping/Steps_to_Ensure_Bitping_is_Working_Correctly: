Steps to Ensure Bitping is Working Correctly:
Verify Your Email: Ensure your Bitping account email is fully verified, which may require checking your inbox for a confirmation link from Bitping.

Keep Your Node Running: It may take some time for jobs to be assigned to your node. You can keep the node running in the background, and over time, it should start performing jobs, leading to passive income.

Monitor Node Activity:

Run the following command periodically to check if jobs have started:
 
 
bitpingd status
Check Earnings:

Go to the Bitping Dashboard and log in to your account to monitor jobs performed and your earnings.
Withdraw Earnings:

Once you accumulate enough earnings, you can withdraw them via the Bitping Dashboard. Follow the withdrawal instructions provided in the "Wallet" section of the dashboard to transfer earnings to your preferred payment method.
Keep the node running for extended periods to maximize potential jobs and earnings. The network might assign jobs gradually depending on the demand and the region you're operating from.
