A USB Bluetooth adapter compatible with Linux https://amzn.to/3CUf6iN
Setting up the Virtual Machine
Download VirtualBox and VirtualBox Extension Pack Download
Download a Linux Distro (I'm using Lubuntu x86) Download

Format the USB flash drive to the FAT32 filesystem
This will erase all data on the drive, make sure you select the correct drive and that it doesn't contain anything important
Copy boot.elf from the downloaded hackmii_installer_v1.2.zip and paste it on the root of the USB flash drive
Safely remove the flash drive and insert it into the Wii using the USB port closest to the edge of the console
