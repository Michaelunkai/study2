Customize the VirtualBox BIOS Image
From the VirtualBox documentation:
The image must be an uncompressed 256 color BMP file without color space information (Windows 3.0 format). The image must not be bigger than 640 x 480.

Method 1 - Editing the VirtualBox VM XML
Make sure the VM being modified is not running
Close the VirtualBox UI
Open File Explorer
Navigate to the VM directory
Open the .vbox file in a text editor
Search for BIOS
Add the following line inside the BIOS node
<logo displaytime="0" fadein="true" fadeout="true" imagepath="C:\Full\Path\to\BIOS.bmp" />

Change the imagePath to the full path to the custom .bmp file
Save the changes to the .vbox file
Start the VM normally to test
Method 2 - Using the VBoxManage Command
Make sure the VM being modified is not running
Launch command prompt as administrator and run the following commands
cd %programfiles%\Oracle\VirtualBox
VBoxManage modifyvm "CaseSensitiveVMName" --bioslogoimagepath "C:\Full\Path\to\BIOS.bmp"
Start the VM normally to test
