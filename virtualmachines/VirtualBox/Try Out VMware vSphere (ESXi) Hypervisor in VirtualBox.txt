Try Out VMware vSphere (ESXi) Hypervisor in VirtualBox
NOTE: This is a helpful exercise to get familiar with the VMware vSphere (ESXi) installation, user interface and terminology but is not recommended for production use and most, if not all, VMs created inside ESXi will fail to boot. Also, I tried these steps with the latest ESXi 7 version but the installer didn't have necessary networking drivers and would halt early on in the process.
