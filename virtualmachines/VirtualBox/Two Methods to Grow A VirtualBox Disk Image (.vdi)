Two Methods to Grow A VirtualBox Disk Image (.vdi)
NOTE: Make a backup copy of the .vdi before attempting these steps

In this example, we'll be taking an 8GB Raspberry Pi OS VirtualBox VM and increasing the .vdi disk size to 32GB

Method 1: Increasing the .vdi size
This method requires that the virtual disk be dynamically allocated. If the .vdi is fixed size the size cannot be changed and VirtualBox will throw an error when you try to resize it

Launch VirtualBox Manager
Select File > Virtual Media Manager
Find and click the .vdi file to increase in size
Change the size at the bottom of the dialog window
Click Apply and then Close
Download the GParted live disc Download
Back in VirtualBox Manager, right click the VM using the resized .vdi > Settings...
Select Storage from the left navigation pane
Click on or add a new optical drive
Select the disc dropdown to the right > Choose a virtual optical disc file...
Browse to and select the downloaded GParted .iso file
Click OK
Make sure the VM using the resized .vdi is selected and click Start > Normal
If prompted, press a key to boot to the CD-ROM
GParted should begin loading
Follow the prompts to set a keyboard layout and language
GParted will automatically start once the desktop environment is displayed
In the top right corner, select the correct device identifier to work with (ie /dev/sdb)
In the middle section of the interface, right click the partition to resize > Resize/Move
Drag the slider or set the numerical values to set the new partition size > Click Resize
Click the check mark icon at the top center of the interface to Apply All Operations
Once the resizing has completed, shutdown the VM
Back in VirtualBox Manager, right click the VM > Settings...
Select Storage from the left navigation pane
Click on the optical drive
Select the disc dropdown to the right > Remove Disk from Virtual Drive
Click OK
Make sure the VM is selected and click Start > Normal
The VM should boot normally with the OS showing the additional storage available
Method 2: Cloning to a new, larger .vdi
This method can be used on either fixed size or dynamically allocated virtual disks

Launch VirtualBox Manager
Select File > Virtual Media Manager
Click the Create icon at the top left of the dialog window
Select VDI > Next
Select Dynamically allocated > Next
Set the file location and disk size > Create
Click Close
Download the GParted live disc Download
Back in VirtualBox Manager, right click the VM > Settings...
Select Storage from the left navigation pane
Click the Controller to select it > Add Hard Disk...
Find and select the .vdi created previously > Choose
Click on or add a new optical drive
Select the disc dropdown to the right > Choose a virtual optical disc file...
Browse to and select the downloaded GParted .iso file
Click OK
Make sure the VM using the resized .vdi is selected and click Start > Normal
If prompted, press a key to boot to the CD-ROM
GParted should begin loading
Follow the prompts to set a keyboard layout and language
Once the desktop environment loads, minimize the GParted application
Launch the terminal application from the desktop
Run the following commands making absolutely certain the source/if and destination/of are input correctly in the dd command
# output disk information, note the disk identifier for the source and destination targets
sudo fdisk -l
# use dd to clone the source to the destination
dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb bs=4M status=progress
Once dd has completed, restore the minimized GParted application
In the top right corner, select the new larger device identifier to work with (ie /dev/sdb)
In the middle section of the interface, right click the partition to resize > Resize/Move
Drag the slider or set the numerical values to set the new partition size > Click Resize
Click the check mark icon at the top center of the interface to Apply All Operations
Once the resizing has completed, shutdown the VM
Back in VirtualBox Manager, right click the VM > Settings...
Select Storage from the left navigation pane
Click on the optical drive
Select the disc dropdown to the right > Remove Disk from Virtual Drive
Right click on the original virtual disk > Remove Attachment
Click OK
Make sure the VM is selected and click Start > Normal
The VM should boot normally with the OS showing the additional storage available
