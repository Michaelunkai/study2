Run the Official Debian Rolling Release - Sid - in a VirtualBox VM
What is Debian Sid?
Debian Unstable (also known by its codename "Sid") is not strictly a release, but rather a rolling development version of the Debian distribution containing the latest packages that have been introduced into Debian. As with all Debian release names, Sid takes its name from a Toy Story character. In the movie, Sid is the kid next door who breaks his toys and makes nasty creatures of them. - https://wiki.debian.org/DebianUnstable
