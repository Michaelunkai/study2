Running a SteamOS VM in VirtualBox
What is SteamOS?
SteamOS is a Linux distribution developed by Valve. It is open source with some closed source components and is the primary operating system for Steam Machines and the Steam Deck. -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SteamOS
DISCLAIMER
You cannot game in this VM as it lacks graphics acceleration. It is, however, very handy for developers in need of a test version of SteamOS and for testing things in the desktop environment.
