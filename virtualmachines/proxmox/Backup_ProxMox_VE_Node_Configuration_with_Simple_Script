Backup ProxMox VE Node Configuration with Simple Script
NOTE: By default, backup files will be located at /mnt/backups/proxmox. Override this default by setting running
export BACK_DIR="/path/to/save/to/" prior to executing the script. The backup path must exist before executing the script or it will fail

Log into ProxMox VE, either at the console or the web UI and launch the web shell
Run the following commands
# download the backup script from github
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DerDanilo/proxmox-stuff/master/prox_config_backup. 
# make the downloaded file executable
chmod +x ./prox_config_backup. 
# optionally, create a backup directory
# change the directory below before executing
mkdir /mnt/pve/ISOs/config_bkup -p
# optionally, set the backup location
# change the directory below before executing
export BACK_DIR=/mnt/pve/ISOs/config_bkup
# run the file
./prox_config_backup. 
Press CTRL+C to abort or Enter to continue with the backup
