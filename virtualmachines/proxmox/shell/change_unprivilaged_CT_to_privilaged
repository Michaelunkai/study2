To convert an unprivileged container (CT) to a privileged container in Proxmox using the shell, follow these steps:

1. **Stop the Container:**
   First, stop the container you want to convert. Replace `<CTID>` with your container's ID.
     
   pct stop <CTID>

2. **Edit the Configuration File:**
   The configuration file of the container is located at `/etc/pve/lxc/<CTID>.conf`. You'll need to modify this file to change the container's privileges.

   Open the configuration file with a text editor, like `nano`:
     
   nano /etc/pve/lxc/<CTID>.conf

3. **Modify the Configuration File:**
   Remove or comment out the following line:
    text
   unprivileged: 1
   You can comment it out by adding a `#` at the beginning:
    text
   # unprivileged: 1

4. **Set Correct Permissions:**
   Ensure that the container's root filesystem has the correct ownership and permissions. If the filesystem path is different, replace it accordingly:
     
   chown -R 0:0 /var/lib/lxc/<CTID>/rootfs

5. **Start the Container:**
   Start the container again:
     
   pct start <CTID>

After these steps, your container should be converted from unprivileged to privileged. Note that converting a container from unprivileged to privileged can have security implications, so make sure you understand the risks involved.

If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask!


To verify if the container has been successfully converted to a privileged container, you can check the container's configuration and look for the absence of the unprivileged: 1 line. Here's how you can do it:

Check the Container Configuration:
Use the pct config command to display the container's configuration. Replace <CTID> with your container's ID:

 
 
pct config <CTID>
Look for the unprivileged setting in the output. If the container is privileged, this setting should not be present.

Command to Display Configuration:

 
 
pct config <CTID> | grep unprivileged
