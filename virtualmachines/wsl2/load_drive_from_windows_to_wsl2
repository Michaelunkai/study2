Open WSL2 Ubuntu terminal.

Create a mount point: This is where you will mount your D: drive. You can create a directory in your home directory for this purpose.

 
 
mkdir ~/mnt/d
Mount the D: drive: Use the mount command to mount your D: drive to the directory you created.

 
 
sudo mount -t drvfs D: ~/mnt/d
Verify the mount: You can verify that the drive is mounted correctly by listing the contents of the mount point.

 
 
ls ~/mnt/d
If you want this to be mounted automatically every time you start WSL2, you can add the mount command to your ~/.bashrc file:

 
 
echo 'sudo mount -t drvfs D: ~/mnt/d' >> ~/.bashrc
Remember to source your ~/.bashrc file to apply changes:

 
 
source ~/. rc
Now, every time you start WSL2, your D: drive should be automatically mounted at ~/mnt/d.
