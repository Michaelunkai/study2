# Tutorial: Configuring Active Backup Teaming on Ubuntu

Active Backup Teaming, also known as bonding, is a method of combining multiple network interfaces to provide redundancy and improve throughput. Here’s a step-by-step guide to configure and set up Active Backup Teaming on Ubuntu:

### Step 1: Install Necessary Packages
First, ensure you have the necessary packages installed. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ifenslave net-tools
```

### Step 2: Load Bonding Kernel Module
Load the bonding kernel module with the following command:

```bash
sudo modprobe bonding
```

To ensure the module loads at boot, add it to `/etc/modules`:

```bash
echo "bonding" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules
```

### Step 3: Configure Network Interfaces
Edit the network interfaces configuration file. This example assumes you have two network interfaces: `eth0` and `eth1`.

1. Open the configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
```

2. Add the following configuration for the bond interface:

```bash
# Bonding interface
auto bond0
iface bond0 inet dhcp
    bond-mode active-backup
    bond-miimon 100
    bond-slaves eth0 eth1

# Interface eth0
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet manual
    bond-master bond0

# Interface eth1
auto eth1
iface eth1 inet manual
    bond-master bond0
```

### Step 4: Restart Networking Service
Restart the networking service to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo ifdown eth0 eth1 bond0
sudo ifup bond0
```

### Step 5: Verify Configuration
Check the status of your bonding interface to ensure it is configured correctly:

```bash
cat /proc/net/bonding/bond0
```

You should see output that indicates `bond0` is in active-backup mode, and `eth0` and `eth1` are listed as slaves.

### Step 6: Ensure Persistence
Ensure that your bonding configuration persists across reboots. The settings in `/etc/network/interfaces` should take care of this, but it’s good to verify after a reboot.

### Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues, check the following:
1. Ensure the bonding module is loaded:
   ```bash
   lsmod | grep bonding
   ```
2. Review logs for errors:
   ```bash
   dmesg | grep bonding
   ```
3. Verify network interfaces are up:
   ```bash
   ip link show
   ```

This should set up Active Backup Teaming (bonding) on your Ubuntu system, providing network redundancy and potentially improved throughput.
