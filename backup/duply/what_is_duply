Duply is a command-line front-end for Duplicity, a powerful backup tool. It simplifies the process of configuring, managing, and automating backups, making it easier to use than directly working with Duplicity's complex command-line syntax. Duply supports various backup destinations like local directories, FTP, SSH, Amazon S3, and more.

Some key features of Duply:

Automates backup tasks: Duply handles encryption, compression, and regular scheduling of backups.
Supports incremental backups: It performs full backups initially and then only saves changes made since the last backup, saving storage and time.
Encryption: Backups can be encrypted using GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) for security.
Cloud and local storage: It supports both local file systems and remote storage, including cloud services like AWS S3 and Google Cloud.
