`rsync` is a utility for efficiently transferring and synchronizing files between a computer and an external hard drive, a remote server, or between two locations on the same computer. It is commonly used for backups and mirroring and can synchronize data over a network or locally. Some key features of `rsync` include:

- **Incremental Transfers**: Only the parts of files that have changed are transferred, making the process faster and more efficient.
- **Compression**: Data can be compressed during transfer to save bandwidth.
- **Preservation of Attributes**: It can preserve symbolic links, hard links, permissions, ownership, and timestamps.
- **Versatility**: It works with a wide range of files and directory structures and supports various options for customizing behavior.

Here is a basic example of using `rsync`:

  
rsync -avh /source/directory/ /destination/directory/

- `-a`: Archive mode, which preserves permissions, ownership, timestamps, symbolic links, and more.
- `-v`: Verbose, providing detailed information during transfer.
- `-h`: Human-readable output.

For remote transfers, `rsync` can be combined with SSH:

  
rsync -avh -e ssh /source/directory/ user@remote_host:/destination/directory/

In this example, `-e ssh` specifies the use of SSH for the transfer, ensuring secure data transmission.
