README for House Price Prediction Project
This project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment using pandas, scikit-learn, joblib, and Flask.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Virtual environment tool (optional but recommended)
Setup
Clone the repository (if applicable) or create a project directory:

 
 
mkdir house_price_prediction_project
cd house_price_prediction_project
Create a virtual environment:

 
 
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Install required packages:

 
 
pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib flask
Steps to Run the Project
Create a sample dataset:

 
 
  create_dataset.py
This will generate a dataset.csv file in your project directory.

Preprocess the data:

 
 
  data_preprocessing.py
This will preprocess the data and save the preprocessed data files (X_train.pkl, X_test.pkl, y_train.pkl, y_test.pkl) in your project directory.

Train the model:

 
 
  train_model.py
This will train a RandomForest model and save the trained model as model.pkl.

Eva te the model:

 
 
  eva te_model.py
This will evaluate the model and print the performance metrics (MAE, MSE, R² score).

Run the Flask app:

 
 
  app.py
This will start the Flask web server.

Testing the Flask App
You can test the Flask app using a tool like Postman or curl. Here's an example curl command:

 
 
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"features": [0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1, 0, 0]}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict
This sends a POST request to the /predict endpoint with a JSON payload containing the features. The server will respond with a JSON object containing the prediction.

Project Files
create_dataset.py: Script to create a sample dataset.
data_preprocessing.py: Script to preprocess the data.
train_model.py: Script to train the machine learning model.
evaluate_model.py: Script to evaluate the trained model.
app.py: Flask web server to deploy the model and provide predictions.
Explanation of the Output
The output of the data preprocessing step will display the first few rows of the dataset, showing that the data has been loaded and preprocessed correctly. The evaluation step will show the performance metrics of the trained model, including MAE, MSE, and R² score, indicating how well the model predicts the target variable on the test dataset. The deployment step sets up a Flask web server that provides a /predict endpoint to make predictions using the trained model.

This README provides instructions on how to set up, run, and test the machine learning project.
