Step-by-Step Guide to Learning NLP with Python
Step 1: Introduction to NLP
What is NLP and What is it Used For?

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. NLP is used for various applications like sentiment analysis, language translation, speech recognition, text summarization, and chatbots.

Step 2: Setting Up Your Environment
Install Python:

Download and install the latest version of Python from the official website.
Install Jupyter Notebook:

Open your terminal (Command Prompt for Windows, Terminal for macOS/Linux) and run:
 
 
pip install jupyterlab
Install NLP Libraries:

In your terminal, run:
 
 
pip install numpy pandas nltk spacy
Step 3: Getting Started with NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
Installing NLTK:

Open Jupyter Notebook and run:
 
 
import nltk
nltk.download('all')
Tokenization:

Tokenization is the process of splitting text into individual words or sentences.
 
 
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize, sent_tokenize

text = "Natural Language Processing with Python is amazing."
word_tokens = word_tokenize(text)
sent_tokens = sent_tokenize(text)

print("Word Tokens:", word_tokens)
print("Sentence Tokens:", sent_tokens)
Stop Words Removal:

Stop words are common words (like 'the', 'is', 'in') that are usually ignored in NLP.
 
 
from nltk.corpus import stopwords

stop_words = set(stopwords.words('engli '))
filtered_words = [word for word in word_tokens if word.lower() not in stop_words]

print("Filtered Words:", filtered_words)
Stemming and Lemmatization:

Stemming reduces words to their base or root form.
Lemmatization also reduces words to their base or root form but ensures that the root word is a proper word.
 
 
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer, WordNetLemmatizer

stemmer = PorterStemmer()
lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()

stemmed_words = [stemmer.stem(word) for word in filtered_words]
lemmatized_words = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word) for word in filtered_words]

print("Stemmed Words:", stemmed_words)
print("Lemmatized Words:", lemmatized_words)
POS Tagging:

Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging assigns parts of speech to each word (e.g., noun, verb, adjective).
 
 
from nltk import pos_tag

pos_tags = pos_tag(filtered_words)
print("POS Tags:", pos_tags)
Step 4: Full Code
 
 
# Step 1: Install and import necessary libraries
import nltk
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Download all NLTK data (this might take a while)
nltk.download('all')

# Step 2: Tokenization
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize, sent_tokenize

text = "Natural Language Processing with Python is amazing."
word_tokens = word_tokenize(text)
sent_tokens = sent_tokenize(text)

print("Word Tokens:", word_tokens)
print("Sentence Tokens:", sent_tokens)

# Step 3: Stop Words Removal
from nltk.corpus import stopwords

stop_words = set(stopwords.words('engli '))
filtered_words = [word for word in word_tokens if word.lower() not in stop_words]

print("Filtered Words:", filtered_words)

# Step 4: Stemming and Lemmatization
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer, WordNetLemmatizer

stemmer = PorterStemmer()
lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()

stemmed_words = [stemmer.stem(word) for word in filtered_words]
lemmatized_words = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word) for word in filtered_words]

print("Stemmed Words:", stemmed_words)
print("Lemmatized Words:", lemmatized_words)

# Step 5: POS Tagging
from nltk import pos_tag

pos_tags = pos_tag(filtered_words)
print("POS Tags:", pos_tags)
