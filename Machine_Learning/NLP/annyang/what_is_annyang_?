Annyang is a lightweight JavaScript library that allows you to add voice commands to your web applications. It uses the Web Speech API to recognize speech and convert it into text, enabling you to create interactive and voice-controlled web interfaces.

### Key Features of Annyang

1. **Simple Syntax**: Annyang provides a straightforward syntax for defining voice commands and associating them with functions in your JavaScript code.

2. **Voice Command Mapping**: You can map specific voice commands to JavaScript functions, making it easy to trigger actions based on user speech.

3. **Customizable Commands**: You can define commands with optional parameters and use regular expressions to create flexible command patterns.

4. **Browser Support**: Annyang works in modern browsers that support the Web Speech API, such as Google Chrome.

5. **Event Handling**: It allows you to handle various events related to speech recognition, like starting, stopping, or errors.

### Basic Example
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how Annyang can be used:

 javascript
if (annyang) {
    // Define commands and their associated functions
    var commands = {
        'hello': function() { alert('Hello!'); },
        'search for *term': function(term) { alert('Searching for ' + term); }
    };

    // Add the commands to annyang
    annyang.addCommands(commands);

    // Start listening for commands
    annyang.start();
} else {
    alert('Annyang is not supported in your browser.');
}
