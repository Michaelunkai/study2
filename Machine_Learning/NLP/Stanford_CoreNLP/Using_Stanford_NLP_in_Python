 Using Stanford NLP in Python
To interact with Stanford CoreNLP using Python, follow these steps:

Start the CoreNLP Server
Open a terminal and start the Stanford CoreNLP server with the following commands:

 
 
cd stanford-corenlp-4.4.0
java -mx4g -cp "*" edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.StanfordCoreNLPServer -port 9000 -timeout 15000
This starts the server on port 9000. You can adjust the memory allocation (-mx4g) as needed.

Install the Requests Library
If you donâ€™t have the requests library installed, you can install it using pip:

 
 
pip install requests
Create a Python Script to Interact with the CoreNLP Server
Create a Python script named nlp_client.py to interact with the CoreNLP server:

 
 
import requests
import json

# Define the text to be processed
text = "Barack Obama was born in Hawaii. He was elected president in 2008."

# Set up the server URL
url = 'http://localhost:9000'
params = {
    'annotators': 'tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,dcoref',
    'outputFormat': 'json'
}

# Make a request to the server
response = requests.post(url, params=params, data=text.encode('utf-8'))

# Parse the response
output = response.json()

# Print the output
print(json.dumps(output, indent=2))
Save this script and run it using the following command:

 
 
  nlp_client.py
