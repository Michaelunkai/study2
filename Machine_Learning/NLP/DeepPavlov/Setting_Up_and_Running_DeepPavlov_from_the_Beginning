### Complete Step-by-Step Guide: Setting Up and Running DeepPavlov from the Beginning

#### **Step 1: Run the One-Liner Command**
This one-liner will clone the repository, navigate into the project folder, install the required dependencies, install the DeepPavlov package, and start interacting with the model.

  
cd && git clone https://github.com/deepmipt/DeepPavlov.git && cd DeepPavlov && pip install -r requirements.txt && pip install deeppavlov && python -m deeppavlov interact deeppavlov/configs/ner/ner_ontonotes_bert_mult.json -d -i

#### **Explanation of the One-Liner:**
- `cd`: Navigates to your home directory.
- `git clone https://github.com/deepmipt/DeepPavlov.git`: Clones the DeepPavlov GitHub repository to your system.
- `cd DeepPavlov`: Navigates into the `DeepPavlov` project folder.
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`: Installs all required dependencies for DeepPavlov from the `requirements.txt` file.
- `pip install deeppavlov`: Installs the DeepPavlov package itself.
- `python -m deeppavlov interact deeppavlov/configs/ner/ner_ontonotes_bert_mult.json -d -i`: Runs the interactive CLI to use the named entity recognition (NER) model (`ner_ontonotes_bert_mult`) with the required model configurations, downloading necessary data and installing additional model-specific dependencies.

#### **Step 2: Interact with the Model**
Once the command is executed, you will be prompted to input text for the model to process. For example, you can input:
I live in New York and work at Google.
The model will identify entities such as locations and organizations in your text.

#### **Optional Steps:**
- **Train the Model on Your Data:**
   Modify the dataset path in the config file and run:
     
   python -m deeppavlov train deeppavlov/configs/ner/ner_ontonotes_bert_mult.json -d -i

- **Deploy as an API:**
   Run a REST API server:
     
   python -m deeppavlov riseapi deeppavlov/configs/ner/ner_ontonotes_bert_mult.json -d -i

With this guide, you can quickly set up, run, and interact with the DeepPavlov models.
