Duckling is a natural language processing (NLP) tool developed by Facebook (now Meta) that extracts structured information from text. It is particularly useful for understanding and interpreting entities such as dates, times, amounts of money, distances, durations, temperatures, and more.

### Key Features of Duckling:
1. **Entity Extraction**: Duckling can recognize and parse various types of entities from text, converting them into structured data. For example, it can transform "next Tuesday at 3 PM" into a specific date and time.
2. **Multilingual Support**: Duckling supports multiple languages, making it versatile for applications in different regions.
3. **Integration**: Duckling can be integrated with various chatbot frameworks and applications to enhance their ability to understand user inputs.
4. **Open Source**: Duckling is open source and can be found on GitHub, allowing developers to customize and extend its functionalities.

### Common Use Cases:
- **Chatbots and Virtual Assistants**: Enhancing the ability to understand and respond to user inputs involving dates, times, and other entities.
- **Scheduling Applications**: Parsing and understanding natural language dates and times for event scheduling.
- **Financial Applications**: Recognizing and processing amounts of money mentioned in text.

### Example:
Given the input text "Remind me to call John on Friday at 5 PM," Duckling can extract:
- `Entity`: Time
- `Value`: Friday at 5 PM
- `Normalized Value`: A specific date and time in a standard format

Duckling can be deployed as a standalone service or integrated into larger applications to provide robust entity extraction capabilities.
