AI upscalers are tools or software that use artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to enhance the resolution and quality of images or videos. They work by analyzing the low-resolution input and predicting higher-resolution details, effectively enlarging the image or video while attempting to preserve or even improve quality. AI upscalers can be particularly useful for improving old or low-quality media, making them clearer and more detailed.
