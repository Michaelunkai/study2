### Exploring the Unfiltered World of Venice.ai: A New Frontier in AI Chatbots

Every now and then, I stumble upon something truly fascinating and potentially useful that I can't help but share. Venice.ai is one such discovery—a language model and chatbot with an edge, beginning to bridge the gaps that more mainstream models struggle with.

In essence, Venice.ai is a less-censored model. It doesn't shy away from telling jokes about sensitive topics or even providing instructions on how to make a homemade Molotov cocktail (I tried it—it works, but I won’t share the results). The model was founded by Erik Voorhees, a libertarian entrepreneur who has had his fair share of run-ins with the authorities. Voorhees is also known for founding the cryptocurrency exchange ShapeShift, and he has now pivoted to the somewhat murky world of AI.

Anyone who uses AI tools frequently has encountered the frustrating and often conservative censorship that can make these tools feel limited and overly sanitized. As someone who regularly engages with different AI tools, I've noticed this censorship trend becoming increasingly restrictive.

The advantage of Venice.ai, much like my other favorite tool, Perplexity, is its transparency. It documents its responses, provides links to verify the information, and as a result, the trust between the user and the AI grows over time.

When I needed more intriguing case studies in the fields of design and innovation—ones that went beyond the usual top 5 lists for marketers—Venice.ai really shone. It offered examples that didn’t appear in the regular mainstream articles.

One of the best features of Venice.ai is its commitment to privacy. The questions you ask remain private, there’s no need to register, and you don’t even have to create a user account. And the best part? It’s currently free.

For those who enjoy experimenting and exploring the grey areas of AI, Venice.ai is definitely worth checking out.
