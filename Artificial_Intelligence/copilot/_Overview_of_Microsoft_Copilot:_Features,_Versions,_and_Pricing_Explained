**Comprehensive Overview of Microsoft Copilot: Features, Versions, and Pricing Explained**

Yesterday, I posted about Microsoft's latest innovations with their CoPilot. This article delves deeper into everything you need to know.

**Background:**
Microsoft is a major player in artificial intelligence. Besides investing heavily in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, Microsoft has launched its own AI chatbot, Microsoft Copilot.

**Does Copilot Use GPT-4?**
Technically, yes! Copilot uses the Prometheus model, based on OpenAI's GPT-4. Microsoft claims that Copilot now utilizes GPT-4 Turbo, a newer AI model from OpenAI. The GPT-4 Turbo, updated until April 2023, is faster and more accurate than GPT-4, which was last updated in September 2021. Note: Copilot does not use ChatGPT. For clarification, ChatGPT is an application connecting to OpenAI models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, providing a chatbot experience.

**Benefits of Using Microsoft Copilot AI:**
- **Increased Productivity:** Copilot automates tasks, offers smart suggestions, and simplifies workflows, helping employees improve their performance at work.
- **Reduced Workload and Stress:** It handles repetitive tasks, provides valuable insights, and helps reduce workload and improve the overall work environment.
- **Enhanced Collaboration and Creativity:** Copilot’s collaboration features and creative suggestions improve team interaction and spark new ideas.
- **Investment Management:** Businesses can rely on Copilot’s data-driven insights for smarter financial management and savings.

**Is Microsoft Copilot AI Free?**
Copilot is a completely free AI tool, but Microsoft also offers a "Copilot Pro" subscription with additional features. The free version connects to the chatbot via GPT-4 Turbo, allows text, image, and voice searches, accesses plugins, and provides 15 daily tokens for AI image creation. Copilot Pro costs $20/month, offering priority access to GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo during peak times and allowing users to create custom Copilot-powered chatbots. This version also provides 100 daily tokens for AI image creation and integrates with Microsoft 365 apps.
