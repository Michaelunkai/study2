Introduction
In this article, we delve into the fascinating new feature introduced by Midjourney during Passover. This feature allows users to leverage Midjourney's capability to randomly determine styles for image prompts and then apply these styles consistently across various images. This innovative command, --sref random, enhances creativity and consistency in digital projects such as videos, stories, presentations, and brand language development.

Utilizing Random Style Generation
Command: --sref random
Midjourney introduced the --sref random command, which grants the system complete freedom to generate a random style for the specified image prompt. This feature is exclusively applicable to text prompts and cannot be used with image links.
Example Usage:
Text Prompt: Guitar
By repeatedly using the text prompt "Guitar" along with the --sref random command, different styles are generated each time, showcasing the randomness and creativity of the tool.
---
Applying Consistent Styles
Once an image is generated using the random style command, the system replaces the "random" value with a unique serial number representing the style.
Example:
Initial Command: --sref random
Resulting Command: --sref 2242209679
This serial number can then be reused to apply the same style to new images, ensuring consistency across multiple visuals.

Practical Applications
Consistent Style Generation:
- Videos
- Stories
- Presentations
- Brand Language Development
Using the unique serial number, users can maintain a cohesive visual style across various media formats.
Example:
Command with Serial Number: --sref 1956835446
