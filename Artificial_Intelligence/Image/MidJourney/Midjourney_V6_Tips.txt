Creating Text with Midjourney V6: Get 7 Professional Tips and Prompts
Accurate and Clear Text Generation with Midjourney V6
With the launch of Midjourney version 6, many users have noticed significant improvements in how the system handles text generation.
In this post, I will share with you 7 tips with prompt templates to help you leverage the capabilities of V6 to generate text outputs.
7 Tips for Generating Text with Midjourney V6
Midjourney v6 can create amazing text, but it's still not perfect. Here are 7 tips for getting the best results.
1. Enclose Text in Quotes
Place the text you want to appear in the image within quotes. This signals Midjourney to describe that specific phrasing.
Prompt:
"Isometric number shape of “Welcome 2024” in neon light tube–v 6"
2. Use the Raw Parameter to Emphasize Text
Using the –style raw parameter will result in greater accuracy when generating text in MidJourney V6.
Prompt:
"A retro movie poster with the stylized words “FUTURE” in shiny chrome letters, with a robot standing on a cliff edge looking out at a surreal futuristic cityscape at sunset –v 6 –style raw"
3. Lower Stylize Values
Lowering the –stylize values will yield larger and more accurate text, while increasing the values will make the text more complex but smaller.
Prompt:
"A fun shoe advertisement, with the words “JUST DO IT”, featuring brightly colored sneakers untied with bouncing laces, with confetti in the background--style raw --stylize 25"
4. Describe Font Styles
Add descriptive words like "calligraphic" or "bold" to specify the desired font style for the text.
Prompt:
"Text “Love” printed in white font on the back of a denim jacket worn by a man walking down a city street –v 6 –style raw"
5. Try Variations
If the text generation is incorrect initially, but you like the image layout, try using strong variations of the image. You might achieve the correct text in subsequent attempts.
Prompt:
"A realistic standup pouch product photo mockup decorated with honey, oats and chocolate with the word “BIO GRANOLA” –v 6 –style raw"
6. Enlarge the Image
If the text is not generated correctly at first, enlarge the image using Subtle or Creative for sharper results.
7. Text Combination Structure
V6 doesn't require any special prompt, but a recommended starting template from Midjourney will help you explore what works well for multiple subjects in V6.
If you are unsure how to start, follow this prompt structure:
"Text “Your Text” is [ written ] [ details — optional] on [ Object/things/medium ]"
Example 1 – Signage
Text: Hello
Writing Method: Written
Details / Description: In bold letters
Object: On a white background with Rembrandt Lighting
Prompt:
"The text “Cool” written in bold letters on a white background with Rembrandt Lighting–v 6 –style raw"
Example 2 – Letter
Text: I Miss You
Writing Method: Written
Details/Description: In cursive font
Object: on a sketch paper with skylight exposure
Prompt:
"A handwritten letter with the words “I love you” written in cursive font on a sketch paper with skylight exposure–v 6 –style raw"
Example 3 – Typography
Text: Love
Writing Method: Crafted
Details/Description: in fine fluffy plush texture pastel tones on a clean background
Object: A clean, light background with Volumetric lighting
Prompt:
"Letters ‘Love’ crafted in fine fluffy plush texture pastel tones on a clean, light background with volumetric lighting –ar 3:2 –v 6 –style raw"
Additional Tip: It is better to use a ratio like 3:2 or 16:9 if the text is long
Prompt Structure for Commercial Use
There is also a simple structure for commercial use such as products, posters, and advertisements.
Product: Hair Care Product
"A professional product photo of a bottle of natural shampoo and conditioner with flower petals, labeled with “BIO HAIR” –v 6 –style raw"
Product: Body Lotion
"A professional product photo of a pink bottle of body lotion inside a luxurious bathroom, labeled with “SOFT BODY” –v 6 –style raw"
UI Design: Valentine’s Special
"UI design landing page of a scented perfume store with the text “Valentine’s Special” on the header, masculine and minimal design, black gradient color palette –ar 4:3 –v 6.0"
Valentine’s Day Greeting Card
"A Valentine’s day card, with rococo art style illustration of two lovely birds surrounded by flowers, surreal fantasy illustration, dreamy pastel color palette, with the text “Happy Valentine’s Day”–v 6"
Summary
Mastering text generation in Midjourney requires experimentation and practice. Start with quotes, font descriptors, and –style raw. Then refine with stylization adjustments, variations, and image enlargement.
Practice simple prompts first before complex images. The more examples you create, the better your prompt writing skills will become.
