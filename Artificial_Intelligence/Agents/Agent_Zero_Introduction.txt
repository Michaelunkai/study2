**Title: Introducing Agent Zero: A New AI Agent**
**Introduction**
Meet Agent Zero, a new AI agent available as open source on GitHub. What sets Agent Zero apart from other platforms is its ability to create agents and tasks dynamically without predefined settings.
**Main Features**
Agent Zero allows interaction and execution of various tasks such as:
- Coding
- Downloading YouTube videos
- Installing software
Additionally, Agent Zero can delegate tasks to other subordinate agents.
**Examples of Agent Zero's Actions**
1. **Retrieving the time in Berlin using Python code:**
   The agent encounters an error due to a missing library, installs the required library, rewrites the code, and successfully retrieves the time.
2. **Saving information to a file using Node.js:**
   The agent writes JavaScript code to save information in a file named Time info.txt.
3. **Downloading a YouTube video:**
   The agent receives an instruction to download a YouTube video on "RAG." It uses online and offline search tools to gather information and downloads the video using YouTube DL in Python after installing the necessary package.
4. **Extracting audio from the downloaded video:**
   The agent installs the Ffmpeg library and converts the video to an audio file.
5. **Installing Midnight Commander:**
   The agent installs the software interactively, confirming dialogues by sending the appropriate key (such as 'y') and continues with the installation.
6. **Real-time system load monitoring:**
   The agent demonstrates its ability to store and retrieve memories and activate other agents to delegate tasks.
**Conclusion**
Agent Zero is a powerful and intriguing tool available for download as open source on GitHub. It showcases advanced and customizable capabilities for executing various tasks. Itâ€™s worth exploring this tool early on, as the demonstration videos and GitHub stars are still few in number.
