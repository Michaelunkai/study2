Introduction
Research institutes and strategic consulting companies publish forecasts that AI could replace about 300 million jobs in Europe and the United States within a few years. In other words, about fifty percent of knowledge workers in organizations will be replaced by a digital entity. As someone who meets many ventures developing AI solutions and closely follows the field, I want to share with you the dramatic increase in investments in AI ventures focused on intelligent organizational and business agents and assistants.
Intelligent Organizational Agents: The Forecasts
The astounding or frightening forecasts lead new (and old) players to offer and develop solutions focused on integrating intelligent organizational and business agents into the organizational fabric. From developing generic platforms to specialized agents focused on specific activities.

3. Humanization and trust: Agents give AI a human-like appearance, accelerating technology adoption and trust.
4. Usage in existing and new organizational structures: Intelligent agents integrate into existing organizational structures and serve as smart building blocks in flexible and innovative structures.
