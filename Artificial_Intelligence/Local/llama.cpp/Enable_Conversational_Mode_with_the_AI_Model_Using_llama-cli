Enable Conversational Mode with the AI Model Using llama-cli
To interact with the AI model in a conversational manner, use the following command:

 
 
cd ~/llama.cpp/build/bin
./llama-cli -m ~/llama.cpp/build/gpt2.gguf -p "You are a helpful assistant." -cnv
This command initiates the AI in a mode where it behaves like a conversational assistant.
