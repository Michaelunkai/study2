Llama Prompt-Guard is a feature in Llama models designed to provide enhanced control and safety over the generated text. It aims to mitigate risks associated with unintended or harmful outputs by implementing stricter input and output filters. Prompt-Guard uses techniques such as prompt validation, real-time monitoring, and content filtering to ensure that the model's responses are appropriate and align with predefined safety guidelines. This feature is particularly useful in applications where maintaining a high standard of content safety and quality is crucial.
