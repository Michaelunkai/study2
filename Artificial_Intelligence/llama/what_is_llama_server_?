Llama-Server is a framework designed to serve machine learning models, specifically for models developed by Meta's LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) series. It provides an easy way to deploy and interact with these models, allowing users to make predictions, generate text, or perform other tasks using LLaMA models in a server environment.
