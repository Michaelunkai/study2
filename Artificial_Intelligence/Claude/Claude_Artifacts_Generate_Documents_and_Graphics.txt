### Claude Artifacts: Generate Documents, Graphics, and More
**By Dror Gill, July 22**
Anthropic's new Claude 3.5 Sonnet language model introduced the Artifacts feature in its chat interface. This feature generates documents, graphics, code snippets, and websites in a separate window next to the chat, sharable via a Publish button. Recipients can remix these artifacts by adding prompts for further enhancement.
**Example Prompt for Game Creation:**
Create a new twist on the classic Asteroids game, where an angry bird is trying to shoot down alien pigs.
**Additional Prompts:**
- Make a website with this game.
- Add a start game button.
- Make the birds and pigs more realistic.
- Add 3 lives.
- When a pig collides with the angry bird, reduce lives by one and restart the game.
- Show "Restart Game" button when lives reach 0.
**Issues and Solutions:**
- If the game is too basic or buggy, use the remix feature to add more prompts and improve it.
