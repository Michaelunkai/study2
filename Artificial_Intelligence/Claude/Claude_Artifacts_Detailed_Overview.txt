Abstract:
Claude Artifacts, introduced with Claude 3.5 Sonnet by Anthropic, empower users to generate, refine, and share diverse content types directly within the Claude platform. These artifacts encompass text documents, code snippets, interactive HTML+JavaScript tools, visual designs, and more. Designed to be self-contained and reusable, Artifacts enhance workflows for developers, project managers, and creative professionals by enabling rapid prototyping and deployment of interactive elements.
