Canva's new plugin for ChatGPT 4, launched on September 7, 2023, aims to help companies and entrepreneurs design visual assets like logos, banners, websites, and images directly from the chat, without needing to open a Canva account. Currently, this plugin is available only for ChatGPT 4 subscribers paying a monthly fee of $20.
## Adding the Canva Plugin
To add the Canva plugin:
1. Open the plugin store in ChatGPT 4. If you don’t have ChatGPT 4, upgrade by clicking the “Upgrade” option under your name at the bottom left, entering your credit card details, and subscribing to the monthly plan. You can cancel anytime.
2. Click the three dots next to your name, then “Settings and Beta.”
3. Ensure the plugin interface is enabled under “Beta Features” on the left.
4. In the “Model” section, make sure you are using ChatGPT 4. Click the dropdown and select the plugin store.
5. Search for “Canva” in the plugin store and click “Install” once you find it.
## Designing with the Plugin
The most exciting part of using the plugin is the ability to design with the chatbot at the click of a button. Here’s how to maximize its potential:
- Write a detailed prompt. For example, instead of writing “Create a logo for an AI business,” specify “Create a gold logo on a white background for an AI business.”
- The plugin will generate five design options based on your prompt. More specific prompts will yield richer designs.
- Choose a design to continue working on it in Canva.
