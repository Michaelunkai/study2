Tips and Tricks for ChatGPT Vision
What is ChatGPT Vision?
ChatGPT Vision analyzes and understands the content of images provided by users. It uses images to create text-based responses, analyze image content, answer questions about them, or provide information. This model is powered by GPT-4V, the latest AI model from OpenAI.
How it Works
- Connect to ChatGPT via the website or app.
- Select GPT-4 at the top of the screen and choose the default option from the dropdown menu.
- Look for the pin or upload icon at the bottom left corner of the screen.
- If you're using a computer, you can also drag and drop an image into the chat.
