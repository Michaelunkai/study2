In this article, we will explore some of the special and hidden abilities of ChatGPT that are not known to most users.
ChatGPT - A Swiss Army Knife on Steroids
Converting Video and Audio Files
Converting MP4 Files to MP3
One of ChatGPT's lesser-known features is its ability to convert video files in MP4 format to audio files in MP3 format. This capability is particularly useful for video editors, podcasters, and digital creators. To use this feature, upload the file to the chat and use the following prompt:
"Please convert the following file from MP4 to MP3"
Converting GIF to MP4
ChatGPT can also convert GIF files to MP4 video files quickly and efficiently. To use this feature, upload the GIF file to the chat and use the following prompt:
"Convert the following GIF file to MP4 video"
Graphic Manipulations for Images
Changing Image Tones
ChatGPT offers tools for image editing, including tone changes and converting images to "sepia" tones, giving them a retro look. To use this feature, upload an image and ask the chat to change its tones to the desired look:
"Change the tones of this image to sepia"
Converting Image to Black and White
Another ability of ChatGPT is converting colored images to black and white, useful for artistic or professional needs. To use this feature, upload an image and ask the chat to convert its colors:
"Convert this image to black and white"
Enlarging Images
ChatGPT can also act as an upscaler to enlarge images, although without sharpening or fixing flaws. To use this feature, upload an image and ask the chat to enlarge it:
"Enlarge this image by 2 times and sharpen it"
Extracting Information from Images
Extracting Text from an Image
ChatGPT can "see" images and extract text from them, allowing you to turn a static image into an editable document. For example, to use this feature, you can upload an image and ask the chat to extract the text and save it as a PDF or WORD file:
"Here is an image of _____. Extract the text from the image and show it to me."
"Save the text as a PDF file; save the text as a WORD file"
Converting a Photographed Table to an Editable Table
Using ChatGPT, you can convert an image of a table into an editable table. To use this feature, upload an image of a table and ask the chat to convert it into a digital table:
"Here is an image of a table. Convert the image into a table that I can analyze and process."
Additional Capabilities â€“ Data Visualization and Analysis
ChatGPT also offers advanced functionality for data analysis and creating graphs. To use this feature, you can upload data files and ask the chat to perform statistical analyses and generate significant insights:
"Analyze the data in the attached Excel file and present the main insights."
"Create a bar chart from the data in the following table."
"Prepare a heat map showing the distribution of sales by geographic areas."
