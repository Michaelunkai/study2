Last Thursday, July 11, 2024, I had the honor of hosting a fascinating webinar on deepfake, AI video, and viral content creation with my friend and colleague (and AI monster) – Uri Bajorno. Hundreds of people registered for the webinar, but only 200 got access to the live Zoom. Feel free to read and watch the event summary and its recording.
Webinar Recording
Let's start with the end – here you can watch the recording of the webinar.
Claude and Sono Write Songs
As usual, we opened the webinar with a song created entirely using artificial intelligence. The song was written using the Claude 3.5 Sonnet language model, which is available to everyone for free. In the prompt I wrote in Claude, I inputted three articles: two about video generators that starred in the webinar – “Luma Dream Machine” and “Gen3 Alpha” – and the third was an article about Uri Bajorno's work, which was posted on LetsAI. I asked Claude to write a song about Uri, myself, and the webinar itsel...
A New Job is Born: AI Leader
During the interview with Uri, we delved into his professional journey and insights in the AI industry. Uri, who currently serves as a Generative AI Expert in Gitam's innovation department, shared fascinating insights from his rich experience.
We extensively discussed the growing importance of AI leaders in organizations and companies. We explained how these professionals lead companies forward in the field of AI, help integrate technologies into various departments, and train employees for more efficient work. The impressive results speak for themselves: improved efficiency, increased revenue, and optimal resource utilization. All these explain why many companies choose to hire experts and AI personnel to fill this important role – highlighti...
Artificial Intelligence – Another Format for Conveying Messages and Emotions
One of the exciting moments in the webinar was when Uri presented the impressive clip he created with Sheli Or Gisar in memory of the "Nova" festival events in Reim. The clip includes an AI version of the song “Hurricane” (sung by Eden Golan in the Eurovision). Uri shared that the clip reached Keren Peles (one of the song's creators) and Keren was very moved by the unique product.
After that, Uri mentioned that a few days after the clip's release, which they created in Runway’s Gen2 and Haiper, the video generator Dream Machine by Luma was released to the public, demonstrating very impressive performance. In the webinar, we demonstrated the dramatic differences between the outputs produced by these tools, including a comparison between Runway Gen2, Haiper, and the innovative “Luma Dream Machine”.
There are No Limits to Imagination – Superman and Deadpool in a Philosophical Discussion
Next, I presented a project that has accompanied me for several years. A philosophical discussion between Superman and Deadpool about the meaning of morality in the world of superheroes. The project was born when I compared the creative writing abilities of Bard (now Copilot) and ChatGPT4. Needless to say, ChatGPT outperformed Bard and created a particularly original and creative text. For almost two years, this text lay in my drawer, but when I started recording my course on creating films with AI, I de...
In the webinar, I shared the challenges I encountered, such as generating speech for a character without a mouth (Deadpool) and animating Superman's character (an action usually blocked by most lip-sync tools). I demonstrated advanced techniques to overcome these obstacles, including using Runway’s motion brush and "lazy animation", and even a technique for animating famous actors' characters (like Henry Cavill, who plays Superman in DC films); these techniques are extensively taught in our courses at Le...
Anyone Can Work with AI
Towards the end of the webinar, we presented practical guides for leading tools like Gen3 Alpha and Luma Dream Machine. We emphasized that on our website you can find free guides for various tools to help you start your journey in the fascinating world of AI content creation, but our courses provide comprehensive and deep training preparing participants for success in the industry.
As those at the forefront of this technology, we can confidently say that the future of AI content creation looks more promising and exciting than ever.
