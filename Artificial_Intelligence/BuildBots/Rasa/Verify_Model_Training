Verify Model Training
After initializing your project, ensure that Rasa has created and trained an initial model. Navigate to the models directory and list the contents to verify:

 
 
cd your-rasa-project
ls models
You should see at least one model file, typically named with a timestamp or as a .tar.gz file.
