Rasa is an open-source framework for building conversational AI applications, such as chatbots and voice assistants. It's designed to give developers the tools to create sophisticated AI that can handle complex dialogue management and integrate with existing systems. Rasa's main components are Rasa NLU (Natural Language Understanding) for understanding user messages and Rasa Core for managing conversations. It allows deep customization and flexibility in designing conversation flows and integrates easily with other platforms and services. Rasa is especially favored for its capabilities to be deployed on-premises, ensuring full control over data and privacy.
