Using Custom Actions:
Your setup indicates that you might be interested in creating custom actions. These are actions that the bot can execute in response to user inputs which may involve external logic, like querying a database or calling an API.

Create a Custom Action:
First, ensure you have an actions.py file in your project directory where you can define custom actions.

Define an Action:
In the actions.py file, you can define a custom action like this:

 
 
from rasa_sdk import Action, Tracker
from rasa_sdk.executor import CollectingDispatcher

class ActionHelloWorld(Action):
    def name(self):
        return "action_hello_world"

    def run(self, dispatcher, tracker, domain):
        dispatcher.utter_message(text="Hello World from custom action!")
        return []
Run the Action Server:
After defining your custom actions, you need to start the action server by running:

 
 
rasa run actions
This command should be run in a separate terminal or background process.
