# Building a Custom Chatbot Tailored to Your Service with ChatBase
## Introduction
Artificial intelligence (AI) enables us to enhance our work and explore new possibilities previously requiring experience, knowledge, or time we didn't have. Building a custom AI-based chatbot tailored to your service can significantly improve customer interaction without needing a programmer.
## Creating a Custom AI-Based Chatbot for Your Service
### Step 1: Understanding ChatBase
ChatBase allows you to create a personalized AI-based chatbot that can scan all pages associated with your website's domain with a single click. The result is a chatbot that can be added as a floating widget to your site, capable of answering any question regarding the content on your site.
### Step 2: Setting Up Your Chatbot
1. **Create Your Chatbot for Free**: Click on the trial option to generate one free chatbot.
2. **Upload Files or Add a Website Link**: Upload one or multiple files or add a link to your site for the AI to scan the site's pages or the content you uploaded.
3. **Domain Scanning**: For those with an active site, the domain scanning option is easy and straightforward.
4. **Free Chatbot Limitations**: The free chatbot can scan up to 400,000 words and up to 10 page links, making it an excellent solution for small sites. For more links, consider upgrading to a paid plan.
### Step 3: Configuring General Capabilities
1. **Naming Your Chatbot**: In the general settings, give your new bot a name.
2. **Setting AI Model**: The basic instruction allows you to customize the personality and style of your new chatbot. You can use the example instruction and upgrade it to be specific to your service's information and personality.
   - Example instruction: "I want you to act as a support agent. Your name is 'Gratitude AI Assistant'. You will provide me with answers from the given info. If the answer is not included, say exactly 'Hmm, I am not sure.' and stop after that. Refuse to answer any question not about the info. Never break character."
### Step 4: Configuring the Chat Interface
1. **Opening Message**: Define the opening message of the chat. For example: "ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I am Gratitude AI, ask me anything about Gratitude!"
2. **Suggested Questions**: Set frequently asked questions that can be suggested. For example:
   - "What is Gratitude?"
   - "How to implement it on Shopify?"
3. **Customization**: Enhance the chat's appearance by adding a logo and name to be displayed in the interface and changing the color of user responses according to your site's color scheme.
### Step 5: Security Settings
1. **Private or Public Chat**: Determine whether the chat you built is private (for you only) or public. If public, you can specify the domains where the chat will be authorized to appear.
   - Example: Build a chatbot from your Shopify site's domain and set it on your site. You now have a chatbot that can answer any question about Shopify on your site.
### Step 6: Collecting Leads
1. **Information Collection**: Configure the bot to request information such as name, email, and phone number to create leads.
### Step 7: Embedding the Chat on Your Site
1. **Embedding Options**: Once you have finished configuring your chat, click the embed button.
2. **Embedding Script**: A window will open with two options, the bottom one being the ability to embed the chatbot as a floating widget on your site.
### Practical Implementation
1. **Script Example**: The embedded script code appears as a floating bubble. When hovered over, it shows the initiated message you defined.
2. **Chat Appearance**: Click on the bubble to see the chatbot in action.
## Conclusion
By following these steps, you can create a custom AI-based chatbot tailored to your service, improving customer interactions and providing instant, accurate answers based on your site's content.
