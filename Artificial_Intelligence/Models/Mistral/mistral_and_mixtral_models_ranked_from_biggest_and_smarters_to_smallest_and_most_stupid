Thank you for asking me to include the Mistral 8x7B model. Based on the new search results, I can now provide a more comprehensive ranking of the Mixtral and Mistral models, from the largest and most capable to the smallest. Here's the updated ranking:

1. Mistral Large
   According to the Mistral AI documentation, Mistral Large achieves the highest score (84.0%) on their benchmark, making it the most capable model in their lineup.

2. Mixtral 8x22B
   This model scores 77.8% on the same benchmark, placing it second in capability. It's a large sparse mixture of experts (SMoE) model with 176 billion parameters (8 x 22B).

3. Mistral Small
   Surprisingly, this model outperforms some larger models with a score of 72.2%. However, its exact size is not specified in the search results.

4. Mixtral 8x7B
   This model scores 70.6% on the benchmark. It's described as a high-quality sparse mixture of experts model with open weights, containing 56 billion parameters (8 x 7B).

5. Mistral Nemo
   Scoring 68% on the benchmark, Mistral Nemo is positioned between Mixtral 8x7B and Mistral 7B in terms of capability.

6. Mistral 7B
   This is the smallest model mentioned in the results, scoring 62.5% on the benchmark. It's described as highly efficient compared to other open models.

Key points to note:

1. The Mistral 8x7B you mentioned is actually called Mixtral 8x7B. It's part of the Mixtral family, which uses the mixture of experts architecture.

2. The ranking is based on Mistral AI's own benchmarking, as reported in their documentation. Different benchmarks or specific tasks might yield slightly different rankings.

3. Model size doesn't always correlate directly with capability. For example, Mistral Small outperforms the larger Mixtral 8x7B on their benchmark.

4. All these models are described as highly efficient compared to other open models in their respective size categories.

5. The "smallest and most stupid" model in this lineup would be Mistral 7B, although "stupid" is not an appropriate term as it's still a very capable model, just less so compared to its larger siblings.

This ranking provides a clear picture of how these models compare in terms of overall capability according to Mistral AI's benchmarks. However, the best model for a specific task may vary depending on the requirements, computational resources available, and the specific use case.
