Efficient and Hassle-Free Music Video Creation with Noisee: Transforming Your Music into Visual Masterpieces
Abstract
In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized various creative domains, including music and video production. This article delves into the innovative AI-powered tool, Noisee, which enables musicians and creators to effortlessly transform their musical pieces into captivating music videos. Noisee, a generative video creation tool, simplifies the process by allowing users to upload an audio file or provide a music link, resulting in a fully generated music video within seconds. This article provides a comprehensive overview of Noisee's features, usage, subscription plans, and its impact on the music and video production industry.
Introduction
Creating visually engaging content that complements music has traditionally been a labor-intensive process requiring expertise in both music and video production. Noisee, an AI-driven tool launched recently, addresses this challenge by offering an intuitive platform for generating music videos. Whether you are an experienced musician or a novice, Noisee promises to enhance your content by adding a new visual dimension to your music.
Features and Functionality
Noisee's primary appeal lies in its simplicity and efficiency. Users can access Noisee via its dedicated website or Discord. The process involves a straightforward registration using Google or Discord accounts, followed by the upload of an audio file (MP3) or a link to music hosted on platforms like YouTube and Suno. Once the music is uploaded, users can select graphic styles, video dimensions, and provide a textual prompt to describe the desired visual elements. Noisee then generates a 30-second video clip that aligns with the music and user inputs.
Subscription Plans
Noisee offers two main subscription packages:
1. Free Plan (Starters):
   - Cost: Free
   - Features:
     - No fast generation time.
     - 100 Relax Seconds (slow generation) per day.

     - Up to 60 seconds per video.
     - Creation of one additional video simultaneously.
2. Paid Plan (Creators):
   - Cost: $20 per month
   - Features:
     - 1,000 Fast Seconds per month (fast generation).
     - 200 Relax Seconds per day after Fast Seconds are used.
     - Up to three style image uploads.
     - Up to 60 seconds per video.
     - Creation of three additional videos simultaneously.
Video Creation Process
To create a video with Noisee:
1. Register on the Noisee website or Discord.
2. Upload your music file or provide a link.
3. Customize the video by selecting styles, dimensions, and adding descriptive prompts.
4. Click "Generate" to create the video.
For videos longer than 30 seconds, users can repeatedly upload 30-second segments of the same music and later stitch them together using free video editing software like Clipchamp or Kapwing.
Commercial Use and Limitations
Free plan users can only use videos for personal purposes. The Creator plan permits commercial use, provided the user holds the rights to the music. It is crucial to note that if the music is created on platforms like Suno under a free plan, commercial rights are not granted, necessitating paid subscriptions for both Noisee and the music platform.
Conclusion and Expert Opinion
Noisee is not on par with more sophisticated tools like Sura or Luma, but it offers a fun, quick, and efficient solution for generating music videos. Its seamless integration with platforms like Suno and its user-friendly interface make it an attractive option for creators seeking to produce audio-visual content swiftly. Noisee has garnered significant attention in the content creation community, particularly among musicians looking for a comprehensive tool that does not require extensive expertise in video editing.
