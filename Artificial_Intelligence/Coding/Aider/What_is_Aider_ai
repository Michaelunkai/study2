Aider AI is an advanced AI-powered tool designed for pair programming, which allows developers to collaborate with large language models (LLMs) directly in their terminal. It integrates seamlessly with local git repositories to assist in editing code, adding features, fixing bugs, refactoring, and updating documentation.

Key features of Aider include:
- **Interactive Code Editing**: Aider performs real-time code edits based on user requests and integrates these changes directly into the local repository, committing with sensible messages.
- **Multi-file Support**: Aider can handle complex requests that span multiple files, making it suitable for larger codebases.
- **LLM Integration**: It works best with GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet but can connect to various other LLMs, offering flexibility based on the user's preference.
- **Top Performance**: Aider has achieved state-of-the-art results on the SWE Bench and SWE Bench Lite benchmarks, demonstrating its capability to solve complex coding problems effectively.
- **Voice-to-code and Additional Features**: Users can code with their voice, add images and URLs to the chat for content reading, and more, enhancing the overall development experience.

Aider's primary use case is to enhance coding productivity by leveraging AI to handle routine coding tasks, fix errors, and implement new features efficiently, while still keeping the developer in control of the process【6†source】【7†source】【8†source】【9†source】【10†source】.
