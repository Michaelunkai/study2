You can also integrate Pyroscope with your CI/CD pipelines to continuously profile your code during builds and deployments.
Add Pyroscope to your CI/CD pipeline configuration. For example, in a GitHub Actions workflow:


name: CI Profiling
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Pyroscope
        run: |
          docker run -d -p 4040:4040 grafana/pyroscope
      - name: Run tests with profiling
        run: |
          pyroscope exec -- your_test_command
