Post-Exploitation with Meterpreter - System Information
After successfully exploiting a target system using Metasploit's Meterpreter, it's essential to gather system information to better understand the compromised host. The sysinfo command is a useful tool for retrieving key information about the target system.

Using the sysinfo Command
To retrieve system information, follow these steps:

Access a Meterpreter session on the compromised host. You should already have an active Meterpreter session. If not, establish one by using the appropriate Metasploit exploit.

Once you have an active Meterpreter session, you can execute the sysinfo command:

meterpreter > sysinfo
meterpreter > ps
meterpreter > migrate 4536
meterpreter > screenshot
