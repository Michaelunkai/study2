Metagoofil is an information-gathering tool designed for extracting metadata from public documents (e.g., PDFs, DOCs, PPTs, XLS files) available on the Internet. The metadata extracted can include details like usernames, software versions, file paths, email addresses, and other sensitive information that might be embedded in the documents. This tool is often used in penetration testing and cybersecurity to gather intelligence on a target organization.

### Key Features of Metagoofil:

1. **Document Type Search**: It can search for various document types such as PDFs, DOCs, PPTs, and XLS files from specified domains.
2. **Metadata Extraction**: Extracts metadata from the downloaded documents, revealing information that could be useful for social engineering, phishing, or further exploitation.
3. **Detailed Report**: Generates a report of the findings, listing all the extracted metadata and providing insights into the potential attack vectors.

### Usage:

Typically, Metagoofil is used by cybersecurity professionals to perform reconnaissance on a target by analyzing publicly available documents. This process helps in identifying potential vulnerabilities and gaining insights into the organizational structure and technological environment of the target.

### Example Command:

  
metagoofil -d example.com -t pdf,doc,xls,ppt -l 200 -n 50 -o /outputfolder -f report.html

- `-d` specifies the target domain.
- `-t` specifies the file types to search for.
- `-l` limits the number of results per file type.
- `-n` limits the total number of documents to download.
- `-o` specifies the output folder for downloaded files.
- `-f` specifies the format of the report.

Metagoofil can be a powerful tool in the hands of ethical hackers and penetration testers for performing non-intrusive reconnaissance and gathering valuable information without directly interacting with the target systems.
