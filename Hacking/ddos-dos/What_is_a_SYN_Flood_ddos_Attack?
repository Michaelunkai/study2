A SYN Flood attack is a type of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack that targets the process of establishing a TCP connection. Here's a detailed explanation of what it is and what it does to the target:

### What is a SYN Flood Attack?

1. **TCP Handshake Basics**:
   - TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connections are established using a three-way handshake process:
     1. **SYN**: The client sends a synchronization (SYN) packet to the server to request a connection.
     2. **SYN-ACK**: The server acknowledges the request by sending a synchronization-acknowledgment (SYN-ACK) packet back to the client.
     3. **ACK**: The client sends an acknowledgment (ACK) packet back to the server, completing the connection.

2. **SYN Flood Mechanism**:
   - In a SYN Flood attack, the attacker sends a large number of SYN packets to the target server, but never completes the handshake by sending the final ACK packet. This leaves the connection in a half-open state.

### What It Does to the Target

1. **Resource Exhaustion**:
   - The target server allocates resources for each half-open connection. With a large number of SYN packets and no corresponding ACK packets, the server's resources (such as memory and processing power) become overwhelmed, leading to resource exhaustion.

2. **Connection Table Overflow**:
   - Most servers maintain a connection table to track the state of each ongoing TCP connection. During a SYN Flood attack, this table can become full, preventing legitimate users from establishing connections because the server cannot handle any new requests.

3. **Denial of Service**:
   - As a result of resource exhaustion and connection table overflow, legitimate users experience slow responses or are unable to connect to the server at all. This leads to a Denial of Service (DoS) where the targeted service becomes unavailable.

4. **Network Congestion**:
   - The attack can also lead to network congestion as a large volume of SYN packets flood the network, causing increased latency and packet loss for legitimate traffic.

### Mitigation Techniques

1. **SYN Cookies**:
   - A technique that allows a server to handle SYN packets without allocating resources until the handshake is completed. This helps prevent resource exhaustion.

2. **Firewall Rules**:
   - Configuring firewalls to limit the rate of incoming SYN packets can help mitigate the effects of a SYN Flood attack.

3. **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS)**:
   - Using IDPS to detect and block suspicious traffic patterns indicative of a SYN Flood attack.

4. **Timeout Reduction**:
   - Reducing the timeout for half-open connections can help free up resources more quickly.

5. **Load Balancers**:
   - Distributing the incoming traffic across multiple servers can help manage the load and prevent any single server from becoming overwhelmed.

Understanding and implementing these mitigation techniques can help protect servers from the disruptive effects of SYN Flood attacks.
