Generate a Payload
After installing TheFatRat, you can generate a payload. Run TheFatRat using the command:

 
 
sudo ./fatrat
Select the appropriate options from the menu. For a basic example, let's generate a payload for a Windows machine:

Choose option 1: Create Fud 100% Fully Undetectable Backdoor with PowerShell
Choose option 2: Fud Win32 EXE to Powershell
Enter the IP address: This should be your attacker's IP (your machine's IP address).
Enter the port number: This will be the port you want the reverse shell to connect back to.
TheFatRat will then generate a payload. Let's say the payload file is named payload.exe.
