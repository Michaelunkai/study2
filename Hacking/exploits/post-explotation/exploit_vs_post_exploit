### Exploit vs Post-Exploitation

**Exploit Phase:**

1. **Definition:**
   - The exploit phase involves leveraging vulnerabilities identified during the reconnaissance and enumeration phases to gain unauthorized access to a target system.

2. **Objectives:**
   - Gain initial access to the target system.
   - Obtain credentials or privileges that can be used for further actions.
   - Establish a foothold within the target environment.

3. **Techniques and Tools:**
   - **Exploits:** Specific code or techniques designed to take advantage of vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, SQL injections, remote code execution).
   - **Payloads:** Malicious software delivered through exploits to establish control (e.g., Meterpreter, reverse shells).
   - **Tools:** Metasploit, custom exploit scripts, automated exploit tools.

4. **Examples:**
   - Using SQL injection to retrieve user credentials from a database (as seen in the Writeup HTB machine)【14†source】.
   - Exploiting SSTI (Server-Side Template Injection) to gain code execution on a server (demonstrated in the Horizontall and Bolt HTB machines)【16†source】【17†source】.
   - Leveraging SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) to access internal services (used in the Forge HTB machine)【18†source】.

**Post-Exploitation Phase:**

1. **Definition:**
   - Post-exploitation involves actions taken after gaining initial access to maintain control over the system, gather additional information, escalate privileges, and move laterally within the network.

2. **Objectives:**
   - Maintain persistence on the target system.
   - Escalate privileges to gain higher levels of access.
   - Collect valuable data (e.g., credentials, sensitive information).
   - Expand access to other systems within the network.

3. **Techniques and Tools:**
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Exploiting misconfigurations, software flaws, or using credentials to gain higher privileges (e.g., using Sudo misconfigurations, exploiting weak services).
   - **Persistence:** Setting up backdoors, creating new user accounts, installing rootkits.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Using the compromised system as a pivot to access other systems (e.g., using stolen credentials, exploiting trust relationships).
   - **Data Exfiltration:** Transferring collected data out of the network.

4. **Examples:**
   - Using Pdb (Python Debugger) to escalate privileges to root by exploiting a misconfigured script (as in the Forge HTB machine)【18†source】.
   - Creating SSH keys for persistent access (demonstrated in the Horizontall HTB machine)【17†source】.
   - Enumerating and exploiting internal services and configurations to gain further access (e.g., using internal network enumeration and pivoting as seen in the Anubis HTB machine)【19†source】.

### Summary of Key Differences:

- **Purpose:** The exploit phase focuses on gaining initial access, while post-exploitation focuses on leveraging that access to achieve further objectives.
- **Techniques:** Exploitation typically involves direct attacks on vulnerabilities, whereas post-exploitation involves a broader range of activities, including privilege escalation, lateral movement, and data exfiltration.
- **Tools:** While some tools overlap, the exploit phase often uses specialized tools and scripts for exploiting vulnerabilities, whereas post-exploitation uses a wider variety of tools for maintaining access and expanding control.
