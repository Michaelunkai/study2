Post-exploitation modules are crucial tools in the penetration testing process. Once you have gained initial access to a system, these modules help you maintain access, gather more information, and escalate privileges. Below are some key post-exploitation modules and their functionalities, derived from the reports you have uploaded:

1. **Gathering Credentials and Sensitive Information:**
   - **Enumeration of Credentials:** Once inside a system, it's essential to look for stored credentials. This can include password hashes, API keys, and other sensitive data.
   - **Password Dumping:** Tools like Mimikatz on Windows can extract plaintext passwords and hashes from memory.

2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - **Kernel Exploits:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the operating system kernel to gain higher privileges.
   - **Misconfigurations and Weak Permissions:** Leveraging weak permissions on files or services to escalate privileges.
   - **Exploiting SUID/SGID Binaries on Linux:** Identifying and exploiting binaries with SUID/SGID permissions that can be leveraged for privilege escalation.
   - **Using Automated Tools:** Tools like `linPEAS` (for Linux) and `winPEAS` (for Windows) to automate the process of finding potential privilege escalation vectors.

3. **Maintaining Access:**
   - **Backdoors:** Installing persistent backdoors to ensure continued access to the system.
   - **Scheduled Tasks and Cron Jobs:** Setting up tasks or cron jobs that provide periodic access or execute payloads.

4. **Pivoting:**
   - **Port Forwarding:** Using tools like SSH or Chisel to forward ports from the compromised machine to your local machine, allowing access to internal network services.
   - **Tunneling:** Establishing tunnels to bypass firewalls and access internal network segments.

5. **Information Gathering:**
   - **Network Scanning:** Performing internal network scans to discover additional targets and services.
   - **File Enumeration:** Searching for interesting files and directories that may contain valuable information.
   - **Database Enumeration:** Accessing and extracting information from databases.

6. **Advanced Exploitation Techniques:**
   - **DLL Injection on Windows:** Injecting malicious DLLs into running processes to execute code with higher privileges.
   - **Exploiting Weaknesses in Services:** Targeting specific services running on the machine for further exploitation.

### Examples from the Uploaded Documents:

- **Forge (Machine)**:
  - **SSRF Vulnerability:** The main webpage can exploit a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability to access services on localhost, such as an FTP server, and extract the SSH key for the user【18†source】.
  - **Privilege Escalation:** Leveraging a misconfigured Python script with `sudo` permissions to spawn an interactive Python debugger and gain a root shell.

- **Horizontall (Machine)**:
  - **Strapi CMS Exploit:** Using a CVE to gain remote code execution on the Strapi CMS and leveraging SSH tunneling to access a Laravel instance running in debug mode for further exploitation【17†source】.

- **Anubis (Machine)**:
  - **ASP Code Injection:** Exploiting an ASP code injection vulnerability to obtain a reverse shell, followed by using Chisel for network pivoting and internal enumeration【19†source】.

- **Bolt (Machine)**:
  - **Docker Image Enumeration:** Analyzing a Docker image to extract credentials and exploiting Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) for initial access and lateral movement【16†source】.

By understanding these modules and techniques, you can effectively conduct post-exploitation activities, maintain access, and gather valuable information to further your penetration testing objectives.
