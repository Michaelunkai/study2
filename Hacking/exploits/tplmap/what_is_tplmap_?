Tplmap is a tool used for detecting and exploiting server-side template injection (SSTI) vulnerabilities in web applications. These vulnerabilities occur when user inputs are improperly handled and are embedded into templates that are later rendered on the server side. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

Tplmap supports various template engines such as Jinja2, Tornado, Django, Mako, and others. It automates the process of testing for SSTI vulnerabilities and provides methods to exploit them if found. The tool can be used to perform actions like:

1. **Injection Detection**: Identifying whether a web application is vulnerable to SSTI.
2. **Template Engine Identification**: Determining the type of template engine used by the web application.
3. **Payload Injection**: Injecting payloads to exploit the vulnerability, including reading files, executing commands, and more.

Tplmap is valuable for security researchers and penetration testers to assess the security of web applications and ensure that they are not vulnerable to SSTI attacks.

Here's an example of how tplmap might be used:

  
tplmap -u 'http://example.com/page?param=value' --data 'key=value'

This command scans the specified URL and POST data for SSTI vulnerabilities.
