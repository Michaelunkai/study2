The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, preceded by several ‘=’ characters.

strings data.txt | grep -o '[=]\{3,\}.*'

This command uses strings to extract human-readable strings from data.txt and then grep to find strings starting with three or more '=' characters, which indicates the presence of the password.
