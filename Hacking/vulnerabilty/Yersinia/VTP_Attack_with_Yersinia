 VTP Attack with Yersinia
You can execute a VTP attack in the following ways:

Inject VTP Advertisement: Pretend to be a legitimate switch and inject VTP messages, overriding existing VLAN configurations on the network switches.

VTP Mode Attack: Change the mode of the switch from client to server or modify the VTP domain information.

Using Yersinia CLI to Launch a VTP Attack:
To list the network interfaces on your Ubuntu machine:

 
 
sudo yersinia -l
This will show all network interfaces. Identify the one connected to your target network (e.g., eth0).

To launch a VTP attack, use:

 
 
sudo yersinia vtp -I <interface>
This will start Yersinia in interactive mode for VTP on the specified interface.

Inside the Yersinia interactive console, you can perform various actions:

Attack Option 1: Inject a VTP advertisement:

 
 
sudo yersinia vtp -i
Attack Option 2: Change VTP mode:

 
 
sudo yersinia vtp -M server
This will change the target switch's VTP mode to "server."

You can also use yersinia to capture and manipulate VTP packets with packet crafting tools like Scapy, but Yersinia's interface provides simpler options for VTP manipulation.
