Risks of SSTI
SSTI can lead to severe consequences, including:

Remote Code Execution (RCE): Execute arbitrary commands on the server.
Data Leakage: Access sensitive data stored on the server.
Denial of Service (DoS): Crash the server or make it unavailable.
Privilege Escalation: Gain higher privileges on the server.
