### What is SSTI (Server-Side Template Injection)?

Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when user input is concatenated directly into a template and subsequently rendered by a template engine. This type of vulnerability can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to various attacks including information disclosure, data manipulation, and remote code execution.

### How SSTI Works

Many web applications use template engines to dynamically generate HTML pages. Template engines like Jinja2 (Python), Twig (PHP), and others enable developers to embed dynamic content within templates. If user input is not properly sanitized before being inserted into these templates, attackers can inject malicious template code.

### Example of SSTI

#### Vulnerable Code

Consider the following example in a Flask application using the Jinja2 template engine:

  
from flask import Flask, request, render_template_string

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def index():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        name = request.form['name']
        template = f"Hello {name}!"
        return render_template_string(template)
    return '''
        <form method="post">
            Name: <input type="text" name="name">
            <input type="submit">
        </form>
    '''

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)

In this code, the `name` parameter is directly inserted into the template without any sanitization, making it vulnerable to SSTI.

#### Exploiting SSTI

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can submit a payload like `{{7*7}}`. When rendered, this payload will be evaluated by the Jinja2 engine, resulting in `49` being displayed.

If the attacker can execute arbitrary expressions, they might be able to execute system commands. For example:

  
{{ self._TemplateReference__context.cycler.__init__.__globals__.os.popen('id').read() }}

This payload, when injected and rendered, can execute the `id` command on the server.

### Risks of SSTI

SSTI can lead to severe consequences, including:

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**: Execute arbitrary commands on the server.
- **Data Leakage**: Access sensitive data stored on the server.
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Crash the server or make it unavailable.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Gain higher privileges on the server.

### Prevention of SSTI

To prevent SSTI vulnerabilities, follow these best practices:

1. **Sanitize User Input**: Always sanitize and validate user input before using it in templates.
2. **Use a Safe Subset of Template Syntax**: Restrict the template syntax to a safe subset if possible.
3. **Avoid Direct User Input in Templates**: Avoid directly inserting user input into templates. Use context variables and render them safely.
4. **Use a Template Engine with Built-in Protections**: Some template engines have built-in mechanisms to mitigate SSTI vulnerabilities.

### Conclusion

SSTI is a powerful and dangerous vulnerability that can have serious repercussions if exploited. By understanding how SSTI works and implementing proper security measures, developers can protect their applications from these types of attacks. Always ensure user inputs are properly sanitized and validated before being rendered by template engines.
