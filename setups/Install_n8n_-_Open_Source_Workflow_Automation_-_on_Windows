What is n8n?
n8n is an extendable workflow automation tool. With a fair-code distribution model, n8n will always have visible source code, be available to self-host, and allow you to add your own custom functions, logic and apps. n8n's node-based approach makes it highly versatile, enabling you to connect anything to everything. -https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n

By default, the n8n database and configuration file live in the user's profile .n8n folder (ie C:\Users\i12bretro\.n8n). To utilize a database other than SQLite, setup the database and authentication, then create a .bat file like the example below and call the .bat file as the action of the scheduled task.

SET DB_MYSQLDB_HOST=localhost
SET DB_MYSQLDB_USER=n8n_rw
