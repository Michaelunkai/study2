Install EmuDeck on Linux
What is EmuDeck?
EmuDeck is a collection of scripts that allows you to autoconfigure your Steam Deck, it creates your roms directory structure and downloads all of the needed Emulators for you along with the best configurations for each of them. EmuDeck works great with Steam Rom Manager or with EmulationStation DE. -https://emudeck.github.io/about/
