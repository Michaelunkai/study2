Running HostMon in Docker
What is HostMon?
HostMon is a simple web-based host monitor and application dashboard. It can be used to monitor the real-time status of hosts and services running in your homelab environment. In addition to monitoring, HostMon has built-in Wake-On-LAN (WOL) capability, SSH client, real-time ping output and the ability to link to your existing Apache Guacamole installation to remotely control hosts from the within browser.

The HostMon application is written in javascript and uses a SQLite database backend. -https://github.com/i12bretro/HostMon
