## Comprehensive Guide to Setting Up and Using RiveScript on Ubuntu

### Step 1: Install Node.js and npm

RiveScript has a Node.js implementation, so you'll need to install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your Ubuntu system.

#### 1.1 Update Your Package List

Start by updating your package list to ensure you have the latest information on the newest versions of packages and their dependencies.

  
sudo apt update

#### 1.2 Install Node.js and npm

Install Node.js and npm by running the following command:

  
sudo apt install nodejs npm -y

#### 1.3 Verify the Installation

Ensure that Node.js and npm are installed correctly by checking their versions:

  
node -v
npm -v

You should see version numbers printed on the terminal, indicating successful installation.

### Step 2: Install RiveScript Using npm

With Node.js and npm installed, you can now use npm to install RiveScript.

#### 2.1 Create a Directory for Your Project

Create a new directory for your RiveScript project and navigate into it:

  
mkdir rivescript-bot
cd rivescript-bot

#### 2.2 Initialize a New Node.js Project

Initialize a new Node.js project in the directory you just created. This command will generate a `package.json` file for your project.

  
npm init -y

#### 2.3 Install RiveScript

Install the RiveScript package using npm:

  
npm install rivescript

### Step 3: Write RiveScript Code

Now that RiveScript is installed, you can create RiveScript files to define your chatbot's behavior.

#### 3.1 Create a Directory for RiveScript Files

Create a directory to store your RiveScript files:

  
mkdir brain

#### 3.2 Create a Simple RiveScript File

Create a simple RiveScript file that will contain the initial script for your bot:

  
nano brain/simple.rive

#### 3.3 Add Basic RiveScript Code

Add the following basic RiveScript code to the `simple.rive` file:

 rivescript
// simple.rive
! version = 2.0

+ hello bot
- Hello human!

+ how are you
- I'm just a bot, but I'm doing fine!

Save the file and exit the editor.

### Step 4: Create a Node.js Script to Load and Run RiveScript

Create a Node.js script that will load and run your RiveScript files.

#### 4.1 Create a JavaScript File

Create a new JavaScript file named `index.js`:

  
nano index.js

#### 4.2 Add Code to Load and Run RiveScript

Add the following code to the `index.js` file to load and run your RiveScript files:

 javascript
const RiveScript = require("rivescript");

const bot = new RiveScript();

bot.loadDirectory("./brain", (batch_num) => {
  console.log(`Batch #${batch_num} loaded!`);

  bot.sortReplies();

  // Now you can get a reply from the bot
  const username = "local-user";
  bot.reply(username, "hello bot").then(reply => {
    console.log("Bot:", reply);
  });
}, (error) => {
  console.log("Error when loading files: " + error);
});

bot.loadFile("./brain/simple.rive").then(botReady).catch(botNotReady);

function botReady() {
  console.log("Bot has finished loading!");

  bot.sortReplies();

  const username = "local-user";
  bot.reply(username, "how are you").then(reply => {
    console.log("Bot:", reply);
  });
}

function botNotReady(err) {
  console.log("An error has occurred.", err);
}

Save the file and exit the editor.

### Step 5: Run Your RiveScript Bot

Finally, run the Node.js script to start your RiveScript bot and see it in action.

#### 5.1 Run the Script

Execute the script using Node.js:

  
node index.js

#### 5.2 Verify the Output

You should see output similar to the following, indicating that the bot has loaded successfully and is responding to inputs:

 plaintext
Batch #1 loaded!
Bot has finished loading!
Bot: Hello human!
Bot: I'm just a bot, but I'm doing fine!

### Additional Steps: Expanding and Integrating Your RiveScript Bot

You can expand your RiveScript files with more complex conversations and integrate your bot into a web application or other platforms. Refer to the [RiveScript Documentation](https://www.rivescript.com/docs/tutorial) and the [Node.js RiveScript Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rivescript) for more advanced usage and features.
