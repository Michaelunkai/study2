Update and Upgrade Ubuntu: Once inside the container, update and upgrade the Ubuntu system:

 
 
apt update
apt upgrade -y
Install Samba: Install Samba inside the container:

 
apt install samba -y
Configure Samba: Now, you need to configure Samba. Open the Samba configuration file in a text editor:

 
 
nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
Configure the [global] section with your desired workgroup and add a new section for your shared folder. For example:

 
 
[global]
    workgroup = WORKGROUP

[ ared]
    path = /mnt/ ared
    read only = no
    guest ok = yes
Save the changes and exit the text editor.

Create Shared Folder: Create the shared folder inside the container and adjust permissions:

 
 
mkdir /mnt/ ared
chmod 777 /mnt/ ared
Restart Samba Service: Restart the Samba service to apply the changes:

 
service smbd restart
Access Shared Folder from Windows: On your Windows machine, open File Explorer and navigate to \\<container_ip>\shared (you can find the container IP address by running docker inspect ubuntu-container). You should see the shared folder and be able to access it like any other network share.
