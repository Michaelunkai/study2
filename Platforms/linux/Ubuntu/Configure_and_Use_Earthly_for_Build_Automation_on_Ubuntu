# How to Configure and Use Earthly for Build Automation on Ubuntu

Follow these steps to set up and use Earthly for build automation on Ubuntu. This guide includes creating a project directory, setting up a Node.js project, creating an Earthfile, and running Earthly commands.

## Step 1: Create and Set Up Project Directory

1. **Create a new project directory and navigate into it:**
      
    mkdir my-project
    cd my-project

2. **Initialize a new Node.js project:**
      
    npm init -y

3. **Install pnpm globally (if not already installed):**
      
    npm install -g pnpm

## Step 2: Create Earthfile

1. **Create an Earthfile in your project directory:**
      
    nano Earthfile

2. **Add the following content to the Earthfile:**
     earthfile
    VERSION 0.6

    FROM node:latest
    WORKDIR /app

    deps:
        COPY package.json ./
        RUN npm install -g pnpm
        RUN pnpm install
        SAVE ARTIFACT package.json AS LOCAL ./package.json
        SAVE ARTIFACT pnpm-lock.yaml AS LOCAL ./pnpm-lock.yaml

    build:
        FROM +deps
        COPY . .
        RUN pnpm run build
        SAVE ARTIFACT dist /dist AS LOCAL dist

    docker:
        FROM nginx
        COPY +build/dist /usr/ are/nginx/html
        EXPOSE 80
        SAVE IMAGE my-app:latest

## Step 3: Create a Simple Node.js Application

1. **Create a simple Node.js application:**
      
    mkdir src
    echo 'console.log("Hello, Earthly!");' > src/index.js

2. **Update the `package.json` file to include a build script:**
      
    nano package.json
    Replace the content of `package.json` with the following:
     json
    {
      "name": "my-project",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "description": "",
      "main": "index.js",
      "scripts": {
        "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
        "build": "mkdir -p dist && cp src/index.js dist/"
      },
      "keywords": [],
      "author": "",
      "license": "ISC"
    }

## Step 4: Run Earthly Commands

1. **Install dependencies:**
      
    earthly +deps

2. **Build the application:**
      
    earthly +build

3. **Create a Docker image:**
      
    earthly +docker

These steps should resolve the issues and allow you to successfully run the Earthly commands. The main changes include using single quotes around the string in the `echo` command to prevent the shell from interpreting the exclamation mark and updating the `package.json` file to include the necessary build script.
