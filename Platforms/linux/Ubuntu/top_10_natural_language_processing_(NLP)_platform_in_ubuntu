Here are the top 10 natural language processing (NLP) platforms that can be used on Ubuntu:

1. **SpaCy**
   - SpaCy is a free, open-source library for advanced NLP in Python. It's designed specifically for production use and helps you build applications that process and understand large volumes of text.

2. **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**
   - NLTK is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources.

3. **Hugging Face Transformers**
   - Hugging Face offers a library called Transformers, which provides thousands of pre-trained models to perform tasks on texts such as classification, information extraction, question answering, and text generation in over 100 languages.

4. **Stanford NLP**
   - The Stanford NLP Group offers a suite of NLP tools that provide pre-trained models and tools for a variety of NLP tasks, such as parsing, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis.

5. **OpenNLP**
   - Apache OpenNLP is a machine learning-based toolkit for the processing of natural language text. It supports the most common NLP tasks, such as tokenization, sentence segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, named entity extraction, chunking, parsing, and coreference resolution.

6. **Gensim**
   - Gensim is an open-source library for unsupervised topic modeling and natural language processing. It’s particularly popular for topic modeling and document similarity.

7. **AllenNLP**
   - Developed by the Allen Institute for AI, AllenNLP is an open-source library built on PyTorch, designed to provide researchers with tools for building state-of-the-art models in NLP.

8. **CoreNLP**
   - Stanford CoreNLP is a suite of NLP tools provided by the Stanford NLP Group. It’s written in Java but can be integrated with Python and other languages using provided interfaces.

9. **TextBlob**
   - TextBlob is a simple NLP library built on top of NLTK and Pattern, providing an easy-to-use API for common NLP tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, classification, translation, and more.

10. **FastText**
    - Developed by Facebook’s AI Research (FAIR) lab, FastText is a library for efficient learning of word representations and sentence classification. It’s particularly known for its speed and accuracy in text classification tasks.

To install these platforms on Ubuntu, you can use `pip` for Python-based libraries:

  
# For SpaCy
pip install spacy

# For NLTK
pip install nltk

# For Hugging Face Transformers
pip install transformers

# For Stanford NLP (CoreNLP)
pip install stanfordnlp

# For OpenNLP (requires Java)
sudo apt-get install opennlp

# For Gensim
pip install gensim

# For AllenNLP
pip install allennlp

# For CoreNLP (requires Java, can use PyCoreNLP for Python integration)
pip install pycorenlp

# For TextBlob
pip install textblob

# For FastText
pip install fasttext

For CoreNLP and OpenNLP, since they require Java, you can install Java using:

  
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install default-jdk

This will help you get started with these powerful NLP platforms on Ubuntu.
