### Tutorial: Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up and Running a Django Project Using the awesome-django Repository in Ubuntu with Python, Git, and Virtual Environment Tools

---

### Step 1: Clone the Repository Using Git
First, you need to clone the awesome-django repository to your local machine using Git.

  
git clone https://github.com/wsvincent/awesome-django.git
cd awesome-django

### Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment with Python's `venv`
It's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies isolated from your global Python environment.

  
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

### Step 3: Install Dependencies with pip
This specific repository is a curated list of Django resources, so it doesn't have a `requirements.txt` file. However, if you were working with a typical Django project, you would install the required dependencies using pip. For this tutorial, let's assume you need Django installed.

  
pip install django

### Step 4: Running the Django Project (Optional)
Since the awesome-django repository is not an actual Django application but a collection of resources, there isn't a project to run directly. However, you can create and run a new Django project within this directory as follows:

  
django-admin startproject myproject
cd myproject
  manage.py runserver

### Step 5: Access the Django Application in Your Browser
After running the Django server, you can view the application by opening your browser and navigating to:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/

### Step 6: Deactivate the Virtual Environment
Once you have completed your work, deactivate the virtual environment to return to your default Python environment.

  
deactivate

This tutorial guides you through the process of setting up and running a Django project using the awesome-django repository in Ubuntu, utilizing Python's `venv` for virtual environments, Git for repository management, and pip for dependency installation.
