Step_1:Install_NTP(NTPsec)
Open a terminal and update the package index:

sudo apt update
Install NTPsec:

sudo apt install ntpsec
Step_2:Configure_NTP(NTPsec)
Edit the NTP configuration file:

sudo nano /etc/ntpsec/ntp.conf
Replace the contents of the file with the following configuration:

# /etc/ntpsec/ntp.conf, configuration for ntpd; see ntp.conf(5) for help

driftfile /var/lib/ntpsec/ntp.drift
leapfile /usr/ are/zoneinfo/leap-seconds.list

# To enable Network Time Security support as a server, obtain a certificate
# (e.g. with Let's Encrypt), configure the paths below, and uncomment:
# nts cert CERT_FILE
# nts key KEY_FILE
# nts enable

# You must create /var/log/ntpsec (owned by ntpsec:ntpsec) to enable logging.
#statsdir /var/log/ntpsec/
#statistics loopstats peerstats clockstats
#filegen loopstats file loopstats type day enable
#filegen peerstats file peerstats type day enable
#filegen clockstats file clockstats type day enable

# This should be maxclock 7, but the pool entries count towards maxclock.
tos maxclock 11

# Comment this out if you have a refclock and want it to be able to discipline
# the clock by itself (e.g. if the system is not connected to the network).
tos minclock 4 minsane 3

# Specify one or more NTP servers.

# Public NTP servers supporting Network Time Security:
# server time.cloudflare.com nts

# pool.ntp.org maps to about 1000 low-stratum NTP servers. Your server will
# pick a different set every time it starts up. Please consider joining the
# pool: <https://www.pool.ntp.org/join.html>
pool 0.debian.pool.ntp.org iburst
pool 1.debian.pool.ntp.org iburst
pool 2.debian.pool.ntp.org iburst
pool 3.debian.pool.ntp.org iburst

# Access control configuration; see /usr/share/doc/ntpsec-doc/html/accopt.html
# for details.
#
# Note that "restrict" applies to both servers and clients, so a configuration
# that might be intended to block requests from certain clients could also end
# up blocking replies from your own upstream servers.

# By default, exchange time with everybody, but don't allow configuration.
restrict default kod nomodify noquery limited

# Local users may interrogate the ntp server more closely.
restrict 127.0.0.1
restrict ::1
Step_3:_Restart_NTP_Service
Apply the changes and restart the NTP service:

sudo systemctl restart ntpsec
Step_4:_Check_Status
Verify the NTP service status:

sudo systemctl status ntpsec
Step_5:_Adjust_Firewall
If necessary, allow NTP traffic through the firewall:

sudo ufw allow ntp
Step_6:_Verify_Time_Synchronization
Check synchronization with NTP servers:

ntpq -p
That's it! Your system should now be synchronized with NTP servers using NTPsec for accurate timekeeping. Adjustments can be made to the /etc/ntpsec/ntp.conf file to suit your specific needs and preferences.
