## **1. Prerequisites**

Before installing **StrongLoop**, ensure that your system has the following prerequisites:

- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or later
- **User Privileges:** Sudo or root access
- **Internet Connection:** Required for downloading packages

## **2. Install Node.js and npm**

Since **StrongLoop** is built on **Node.js**, you need to install both **Node.js** and **npm**.

### **Step 2.1: Update System Packages**

First, update your system’s packages to ensure you have the latest package lists.

  
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y

### **Step 2.2: Install Node.js**

Install Node.js using the **NodeSource** repository to get a more up-to-date version than the default Ubuntu repositories.

1. **Add NodeSource PPA:**

     
   curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -

   *(Replace `18.x` with the desired Node.js version.)*

2. **Install Node.js:**

     
   sudo apt install -y nodejs

3. **Verify Installation:**

     
   node -v
   npm -v

   *You should see the installed versions of Node.js and npm.*

### **Step 2.3: Install Build Essentials (Optional but Recommended)**

To avoid potential issues with some npm packages, install **build-essential**:

  
sudo apt install -y build-essential

---

## **3. Install StrongLoop**

With **Node.js** and **npm** installed, you can now install the **StrongLoop CLI** globally.

  
sudo npm install -g strongloop

### **Verify Installation**

To check that StrongLoop was installed correctly, run:

  
slc -v

This command will display the installed version of StrongLoop.

---

## **4. Set Up a StrongLoop Application**

After installing **StrongLoop**, you can use the **StrongLoop CLI** to scaffold a new application.

### **Step 4.1: Create a New Directory for the Project**

First, create a new directory where your project will be located:

  
mkdir my-strongloop-app
cd my-strongloop-app

### **Step 4.2: Initialize a New Application**

Now, initialize a new **LoopBack** application using the `slc` command:

  
slc loopback

*You will be prompted to enter some basic configuration for your app. You can accept the default options or customize them as needed.*

Alternatively, you can run the following:

  
slc app

### **Step 4.3: Install Application Dependencies**

Once the app is initialized, install its dependencies using npm:

  
npm install

---

## **5. Run the Application**

Once everything is set up, you can start the server and run your application.

### **Step 5.1: Start the Application**

To start the application, run:

  
node .

By default, the application will run on **port 3000**. You can access it at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## **6. Using LoopBack API Explorer**

The **LoopBack API Explorer** allows you to interact with your APIs, view the available endpoints, and execute requests directly from the browser.

### **Step 6.1: Access the API Explorer**

To access the **API Explorer**, navigate to the following URL in your web browser:

http://localhost:3000/explorer

The API Explorer interface will show you all available API endpoints, including routes for your models, and let you test them interactively.

### **Step 6.2: Customizing the Explorer Path**

If you wish to customize the URL path where the API Explorer is served (e.g., changing `/explorer` to `/api-docs`), you can modify the configuration in the `server.js` file:

 javascript
const explorer = require('@loopback/openapi-v3').RestExplorerComponent;
app.component(explorer);
app.configure(RestExplorerBindings.COMPONENT).to({
  path: '/api-docs',
});

---

## **7. Using StrongLoop Process Manager (Optional)**

The **StrongLoop Process Manager (`strong-pm`)** is used to manage the lifecycle of Node.js applications, offering features like clustering and zero-downtime deployment.

### **Step 7.1: Install Strong-PM**

Install **Strong-PM** globally:

  
sudo npm install -g strong-pm

### **Step 7.2: Start Strong-PM**

Start **strong-pm** in the background:

  
strong-pm &

### **Step 7.3: Deploy Your Application to Strong-PM**

1. **Build the Application Package:**

     
   slc build

2. **Deploy the Application:**

     
   slc deploy http://localhost:8701

### **Step 7.4: Verify Deployment**

Check that the application is running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## **8. Troubleshooting**

Here are some common issues you may encounter:

### **Issue 8.1: Permission Errors During npm Install**

If you encounter permission errors, use **nvm** to install Node.js without needing sudo:

  
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
source ~/. rc
nvm install --lts

Reinstall **StrongLoop** without using `sudo`:

  
npm install -g strongloop

### **Issue 8.2: Port Already in Use**

If the default **port 3000** is already in use, specify a different port:

  
PORT=3001 node .

### **Issue 8.3: Application Fails to Start**

- **Check Logs:** Look for error messages in the terminal.
- **Verify Dependencies:** Ensure all required npm packages are installed.
- **Node Version Compatibility:** Ensure that your Node.js version is compatible with **StrongLoop**.
