# **Complete Guide to Installing and Using Plivo on Ubuntu for Communication**

## Introduction

Plivo is a cloud-based communications platform that provides services for sending SMS and making voice calls. This tutorial will guide you through the installation and usage of Plivo on an Ubuntu system, including setting up your environment, obtaining necessary credentials, and creating Python scripts for sending SMS and making calls.

## Step 1: Install Prerequisites

Before installing Plivo, ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can check this with the following command:

  
 3 --version

If Python is not installed, you can install it along with pip (Python package installer) using the following commands:

  
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip

## Step 2: Install the Plivo Python SDK

The Plivo Python SDK can be installed using pip. Run the following command to install it:

  
pip3 install plivo

## Step 3: Sign Up for a Plivo Account

To use Plivo's services, you need an account. Sign up at [Plivo's website](https://www.plivo.com/) if you don’t already have one.

## Step 4: Obtain Your Auth ID and Auth Token

After signing up, log in to your Plivo account to retrieve your Auth ID and Auth Token. These credentials are essential for authenticating your API requests.

## Step 5: Creating Python Scripts for Communication

### Sending an SMS

1. Create a file named `send_sms.py`.

2. Open `send_sms.py` in a text editor and add the following code:

      
    import plivo

    # Your Auth ID and Auth Token
    auth_id = "YOUR_AUTH_ID"
    auth_token = "YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN"

    client = plivo.RestClient(auth_id, auth_token)

    # The phone number to which you want to send the SMS
    destination_number = "DESTINATION_PHONE_NUMBER"
    # The phone number from which the SMS will be sent (must be a Plivo number)
    source_number = "YOUR_PLIVO_NUMBER"
    # The SMS text message
    message = "Hello from Plivo!"

    # Send the SMS
    response = client.messages.create(
        src=source_number,
        dst=destination_number,
        text=message
    )

    print(f"Message UUID: {response['message_uuid']}")

3. Replace `YOUR_AUTH_ID`, `YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN`, `DESTINATION_PHONE_NUMBER`, and `YOUR_PLIVO_NUMBER` with the appropriate values.

4. Run the script:

      
     3 send_sms.py

### Making a Call

1. Create a file named `make_call.py`.

2. Open `make_call.py` in a text editor and add the following code:

      
    import plivo

    # Your Auth ID and Auth Token
    auth_id = "YOUR_AUTH_ID"
    auth_token = "YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN"

    client = plivo.RestClient(auth_id, auth_token)

    # The phone number to which you want to make the call
    destination_number = "DESTINATION_PHONE_NUMBER"
    # The phone number from which the call will be made (must be a Plivo number)
    source_number = "YOUR_PLIVO_NUMBER"
    # The URL that will handle the call logic
    answer_url = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.plivo.com/answer.xml"

    # Make the call
    response = client.calls.create(
        from_=source_number,
        to_=destination_number,
        answer_url=answer_url
    )

    print(f"Call UUID: {response['call_uuid']}")

3. Replace `YOUR_AUTH_ID`, `YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN`, `DESTINATION_PHONE_NUMBER`, `YOUR_PLIVO_NUMBER`, and `answer_url` with the appropriate values.

4. Run the script:

      
     3 make_call.py

## Step 6: Handling Inbound Calls and SMS

To handle inbound calls and SMS, you need a web server. This example uses Flask to set up a basic server for handling inbound SMS.

### Setting Up a Flask Server for Inbound SMS

1. Install Flask:

      
    pip3 install Flask

2. Create a file named `app.py`.

3. Open `app.py` in a text editor and add the following code:

      
    from flask import Flask, request

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route("/sms", methods=['POST'])
    def sms():
        from_number = request.form.get('From')
        to_number = request.form.get('To')
        text = request.form.get('Text')
        print(f"Received SMS from {from_number} to {to_number}: {text}")
        return "OK"

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)

4. Run the Flask server:

      
     3 app.py

5. In the Plivo dashboard, configure your Plivo number to send incoming SMS to `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:5000/sms`.

## Conclusion

You have successfully installed and configured Plivo on Ubuntu for sending SMS and making calls. You can further expand this setup to handle more complex communication needs or integrate with other services.
