Step 1: Understanding NIC Teaming
Check if NIC Teaming is supported on your server:

powershell
Copy code
Get-NetAdapter | Where-Object { $_.LinkLayerAddress -ne $null } | Format-Table Name, LinkLayerAddress, Status
Ensure that all your network adapters have a LinkLayerAddress (MAC address) and are in the 'Up' state.

Step 2: NIC Teaming Modes
Check the available NIC teaming modes:

powershell
Copy code
Get-NetLbfoTeam
Step 3: Creating a NIC Team
powershell
Copy code
New-NetLbfoTeam -Name TeamName -TeamMembers "Ethernet 2" -TeamingMode SwitchIndependent
Step 4: Verify NIC Team Creation
powershell
Copy code
Get-NetLbfoTeam
Ensure that your newly created team is listed, and the team status is 'Up.'

Step 5: LACP Protocol
Check if LACP is supported on your server:

powershell
Copy code
Get-NetLbfoTeam | Get-NetLbfoTeamMember
Ensure that the 'Status' column for each team member displays 'Up' and 'TeamingMode' is set to 'LACP.'

Step 6: Configure LACP for NIC Teaming (Virtual Machine Environment)
powershell
Copy code
Set-NetLbfoTeam -Name TeamName -TeamingMode SwitchIndependent
Step 7: Verify LACP Configuration
powershell
Copy code
Get-NetLbfoTeam | Get-NetLbfoTeamMember
Ensure that the 'TeamingMode' for each team member is set to 'SwitchIndependent.'
