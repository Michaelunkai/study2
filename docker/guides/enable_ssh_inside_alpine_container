vi /etc/s /s d_config
Make sure to set PermitRootLogin to yes if you want to allow root login, and set other configurations as needed.

/etc/init.d/s d start
or
 
 
service s d start

You can now connect to the container using SSH. If you're connecting from the host machine, use the container's IP address or hostname:

 
 
s  username@container_ip
