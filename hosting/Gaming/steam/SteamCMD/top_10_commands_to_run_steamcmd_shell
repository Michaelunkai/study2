Here are the top 10 essential commands to use within the **SteamCMD shell**:

1. **Login to Steam account**:
    plaintext
   login <username>
   Replace `<username>` with your Steam account name. Use `login anonymous` for public servers.

2. **Logout from Steam account**:
    plaintext
   logout

3. **Set installation directory**:
    plaintext
   force_install_dir <directory_path>
   Replace `<directory_path>` with the desired directory for game server installation.

4. **Download a game server**:
    plaintext
   app_update <app_id>
   Replace `<app_id>` with the game's App ID (e.g., `740` for CS:GO).

5. **Validate files of a game server**:
    plaintext
   app_update <app_id> validate
   Ensures all files are intact and properly downloaded.

6. **List all available commands**:
    plaintext
   help

7. **Exit the SteamCMD shell**:
    plaintext
   quit

8. **Check SteamCMD version**:
    plaintext
   version

9. **Remove unused or cached files**:
    plaintext
   @ShutdownOnFailedCommand 0
   Prevents SteamCMD from exiting on errors.

10. **Install a beta branch for an app**:
     plaintext
    app_update <app_id> -beta <beta_name>
    Replace `<beta_name>` with the desired beta branch name (if available).
