# How to Fix Plex TV Shows Folder Not Showing Content

If your TV Shows folder appears empty in Plex despite having content, follow these steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue.

## Step 1: Check Permissions

Ensure that Plex has read access to the TV Shows folder.

### Commands:
```bash
sudo chown -R plex:plex /home/TV
sudo chmod -R 755 /home/TV
```

## Step 2: Verify Folder Structure

Ensure your TV shows are organized correctly. Plex expects a specific folder structure for TV shows.

### Example Structure:
```
TV Shows/
  Show Name/
    Season 01/
      Show.Name.S01E01.mkv
      Show.Name.S01E02.mkv
```

## Step 3: Update Library in Plex

Force a library update from the Plex Web UI.

### Instructions:
1. Go to the TV Shows section.
2. Click on the three dots (â‹®) next to the TV Shows library.
3. Select "Manage Library" > "Refresh All Metadata."

## Step 4: Check Library Settings

Double-check the library settings in Plex.

### Instructions:
1. Go to the TV Shows library settings.
2. Ensure the correct folder is selected (`/home/TV`).
3. Make sure the scanner is set to "Plex TV Series" and the agent is set to "TheTVDB" or "TheMovieDB."

## Step 5: Review Plex Logs

Check the Plex logs for any errors or warnings related to the TV Shows library.

### Location:
Logs can be found in `/var/lib/plexmediaserver/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Logs/`.

### Key Files:
- `Plex Media Scanner.log`
- `Plex Media Server.log`

## Step 6: Clean Up Library

Perform a library cleanup to help resolve potential database issues.

### Instructions:
1. Go to Settings > Manage > Libraries.
2. Select "Clean Bundles" and "Empty Trash" in the TV Shows library.
