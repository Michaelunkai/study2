To find all the created domains in the **Ngrok dashboard**, follow these steps:

### 1. **Login to Ngrok**
   - Go to the [Ngrok Dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/) and log in with your account credentials.

### 2. **Navigate to the "Endpoints" Section**
   - Once logged in, click on **"Endpoints"** in the left-hand menu. 
   - This section lists all the active tunnels and their associated domains.

### 3. **Review Custom Domains**
   - If you’ve created custom domains, go to the **"Reserved Domains"** section. You can find this under **Endpoints → Domains**.
   - This will display all the custom domains you have reserved through Ngrok.

### 4. **Check Tunnel Sessions**
   - In the **Tunnels** section, you can view all the current tunnel sessions. Each session typically has a public URL (domain) generated by Ngrok.

### 5. **Billing and Plans**
   - If you have multiple projects or teams under different plans, ensure you switch between them in the dashboard to see domains associated with each project.

If you're looking for programmatically retrieving this information, you can also use the **Ngrok API** or their CLI with `ngrok tunnels` to list active tunnels and their domains.
