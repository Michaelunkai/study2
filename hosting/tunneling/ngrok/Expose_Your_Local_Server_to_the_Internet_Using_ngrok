Expose Your Local Server to the Internet Using ngrok
To allow Telnyx to reach your local Flask server, expose it to the internet using ngrok. If you donâ€™t have ngrok installed, download and install it. Then run:

 
 
./ngrok http 5000
Ngrok will provide a public URL (e.g., http://123456.ngrok.io). Note this URL as you will need it to configure the webhook.
