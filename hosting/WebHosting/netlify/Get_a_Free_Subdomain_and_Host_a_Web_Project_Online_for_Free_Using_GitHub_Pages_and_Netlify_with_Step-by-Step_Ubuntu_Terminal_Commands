# Step 1: Set Up GitHub Repository for Hosting Your MichaCard Project
# Navigate to the project directory where your index.html and styles.css files are located.
cd /mnt/c/study/programming/frontend/html/projects/MyCard/3

# Initialize a new Git repository to start version control.
git init

# Add all project files (index.html, styles.css, etc.) to the repository.
git add .

# Commit the files with a descriptive message.
git commit -m "Initial commit for MichaCard project"

# Set up the remote repository on GitHub (Replace YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username).
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/MichaCard.git

# Set the branch to "main" and push the project to GitHub.
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

# Step 2: Deploy Your Project on GitHub Pages for Free Hosting
# Go to your GitHub repository at https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/MichaCard
# In your repository, go to "Settings", scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section, and enable it.
# Set the source to the "main" branch, or use a "docs" folder if preferred.
# Your project will now be accessible at: https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/MichaCard/

# Step 3: Obtain a Free Custom Subdomain (michacard.tk) Using Freenom
# Visit https://www.freenom.com and search for "michacard.tk".
# Register the domain and configure it.

# Step 4: Set Up DNS with Freenom for Your Custom Domain
# Log in to your Freenom account and navigate to "My Domains" > "Manage Domain".
# Go to the "Manage Freenom DNS" section.
# Add a CNAME record with the following details:
# Name: www
# Type: CNAME
# Target: YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io

# Step 5: Add Custom Domain Configuration to GitHub Pages
# In your project directory, create a CNAME file to configure the custom domain.
nano CNAME

# Add the following content to the CNAME file:
michacard.tk

# Save the CNAME file by pressing `Ctrl + O`, and then exit by pressing `Ctrl + X`.

# Step 6: Push the CNAME File to Your GitHub Repository
# Add the CNAME file to the Git repository.
git add CNAME

# Commit the new CNAME file.
git commit -m "Add custom domain configuration for michacard.tk"

# Push the changes to GitHub to finalize the custom domain setup.
git push origin main

# Step 7: Deploy Your Project Using Netlify for an Additional Short Domain
# Install the Netlify CLI on your system to deploy your project.
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Deploy the project using Netlify by specifying the project directory.
netlify deploy --dir="/mnt/c/study/programming/frontend/html/projects/MyCard/3"

# Follow the prompts:
# - When asked to link the directory to a Netlify site, select the option to link to your existing site.
# - Choose "michacard" from the list of recently updated sites.
# Once linked, you will see:
# Admin URL: https://app.netlify.com/sites/michacard
# Site URL: https://michacard.netlify.app

# Step 8: Deploy the Project to the Main Netlify URL
# Deploy your changes to the main site URL by using the --prod flag.
netlify deploy --prod

# When prompted, enter the publish directory as "." (current directory):
# ? Publish directory (.)
.

# Step 9: Verify Your Deployment
# Your MichaCard project should now be accessible from:
# - GitHub Pages URL: https://michacard.tk
# - Netlify Site URL: https://michacard.netlify.app

# You've successfully deployed your project for free using GitHub Pages, obtained a custom subdomain (michacard.tk), and set up a secondary short domain using Netlify.
