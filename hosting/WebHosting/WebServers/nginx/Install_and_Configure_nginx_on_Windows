Running nginx Server on Startup
nginx doesn't currently have the ability to run as a Windows service natively. A simple workaround is to create a scheduled task to start the nginx server on system startup

Open notepad and paste the following into a blank text file
start "" /b "C:\Program Files\PHP\php-cgi.exe" -b 127.0.0.1:9123
start "" /b "C:\Program Files\nginx\nginx.exe" -c "C:\Program Files\nginx\conf\nginx.conf"
Save the text file as startup.bat in the nginx installation directory
Click the Start button > Search Task > Click Task Scheduler
Right click the Task Scheduler Library folder in the top left > Create Basic Task
Name the task nginx startup > Click Next
Select When the computer starts > Click Next
Select Start a program > Click Next
Click the Browse... button and navigate to C:\Program Files\nginx\startup.bat
Set the Start in value to C:\Program Files\nginx > Click Next
Click Fini 
Reboot to test that nginx with PHP support starts with the system on boot
