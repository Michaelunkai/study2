Introduction:
We'll now configure Apache2 and host a simple HTML page to understand the basics of web hosting.

Instructions:

Apache2 Configuration Files:

Apache2 configuration files are usually located in /etc/apache2/.
The main configuration file is apache2.conf, and additional configurations are in the sites-available directory.
Navigate to Apache2 Directory:

Run: cd /etc/apache2/
Edit Apache2 Configuration:

Use a text editor (e.g., nano): sudo nano apache2.conf
Explore and understand basic configurations.
Create a Simple HTML Page:

Navigate to the default web root: cd /var/www/html/
Create an HTML file (e.g., index.html) with a basic message.
Restart Apache2:

Run: sudo service apache2 restart
Access Your Web Page:

Open a web browser and enter localhost again. You should see the content of your HTML page.
