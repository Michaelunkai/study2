### **Comprehensive Guide to Resolving Jellyfin Media Deletion Error: Fix Write Access Issues for Media Folders on Linux and Windows**

---

### **Step 1: Verify Folder Permissions for Jellyfin Media Directory**

#### For Linux:
1. **Check the owner and permissions of the media folder:**
   Run the following command to see who owns the folder and its current permissions:
   ```bash
   ls -ld /path/to/your/media/folder
   ```

2. **Assign ownership of the folder to the Jellyfin user:**
   Replace `/path/to/your/media/folder` with the actual path of your media folder. The Jellyfin process usually runs as the `jellyfin` user:
   ```bash
   sudo chown -R jellyfin:jellyfin /path/to/your/media/folder
   ```

3. **Set proper permissions for the folder:**
   Ensure the Jellyfin user has read, write, and execute access:
   ```bash
   sudo chmod -R 775 /path/to/your/media/folder
   ```

#### For Windows:
1. **Locate the media folder:**
   Navigate to the folder containing the media you want Jellyfin to access.

2. **Edit permissions:**
   - Right-click the folder and select **Properties**.
   - Go to the **Security** tab and click **Edit**.
   - Add or select the account running Jellyfin (or use `Everyone` if unsure) and give it **Full Control** permissions.

3. **Apply changes:**
   Save the changes and ensure the Jellyfin server can access the folder.

### **Step 2: Verify and Update Media Folder Configuration in Jellyfin**

1. **Access the Jellyfin dashboard:**
   Open your web browser and go to the Jellyfin interface (default is `http://<your-server-ip>:8096`).

2. **Navigate to Libraries:**
   - Go to **Dashboard** â†’ **Libraries**.
   - Check the folder paths linked to your media libraries.

3. **Update folder paths if necessary:**
   If the folder path is incorrect or inaccessible, update it to the correct location.

### **Step 3: Restart the Jellyfin Server to Apply Changes**

#### For Linux:
1. Restart the Jellyfin service using the command:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart jellyfin
   ```

2. Confirm the service is running:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status jellyfin
   ```

#### For Windows:
1. Open the **Services** application:
   - Press `Win + R`, type `services.msc`, and press Enter.

2. Restart the Jellyfin service:
   - Locate **Jellyfin** in the list, right-click it, and select **Restart**.

   ```

2. Look for errors related to permissions or file access.
