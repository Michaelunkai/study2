gedit /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

Enable Keep-Alive:

It looks like Keep-Alive is already enabled in your configuration, which is good for performance. You can leave it as is:
apache
 
KeepAlive On
MaxKeepAliveRequests 100
KeepAliveTimeout 5
Timeout and MaxClients:

Adjust the Timeout and MaxClients settings for better resource management:
apache
 
Timeout 30
MaxClients 50
Compression:

Enable compression to reduce the size of data sent over the network. Add the following lines:
apache
 
<IfModule mod_deflate.c>
    Set Filter DEFLATE
    DeflateCompressionLevel 9
</IfModule>
LogLevel:

Adjust the LogLevel to control the severity of messages logged to the error_log. For production, it's recommended to set it to warn:
apache
 
LogLevel warn
Directory Settings:

Depending on your specific requirements, you can adjust the directory settings. For example, you can allow .htaccess files in your web directories by changing AllowOverride None to AllowOverride All:
apache
 
<Directory /var/www/>
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride All
    Require all granted
</Directory>
Security Model:

Depending on your application, you might need to adjust the security model. For example, if you're serving content from a sub-directory in /srv, you may need to modify the settings under <Directory /srv/>.
After making these changes, save the file and restart Apache2:

 
 
sudo service apache2 restart
