Deploying Multiple Apps
You can deploy multiple applications to your Dokku instance by following the same process of creating a new app and pushing code.

19.1 Create a new app:

dokku apps:create anotherapp
19.2 Set up a remote for the new application repository:

git remote add dokku-2 dokku@your-domain.com:anotherapp
19.3 Push your application:

git push dokku-2 master
