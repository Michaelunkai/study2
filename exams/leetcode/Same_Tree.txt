### Step 1: Rewrite the Entire Question
**Problem: Same Tree**
Given the roots of two binary trees `p` and `q`, write a function to check if they are the same or not.
Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.
**Examples:**
Example 1:
Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true
Example 2:
Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false
Example 3:
Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false
**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].
- `-10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4`
### Step 2: Explain the Entire Question Step by Step
1. **Given two binary trees:** You are provided with two binary trees, denoted by their root nodes `p` and `q`.
2. **Check if they are the same:** Your task is to determine whether these two binary trees are identical.
3. **Structural and value similarity:** Two trees are considered identical if:
   - They have the exact same structure (i.e., the shape and arrangement of nodes are the same).
   - Corresponding nodes in both trees have the same value.
4. **Examples:**
   - Example 1: Both trees are [1,2,3] which means they have the same structure and node values, so the output is `true`.
   - Example 2: Trees are [1,2] and [1,null,2]. They have different structures, so the output is `false`.
   - Example 3: Trees are [1,2,1] and [1,1,2]. They have the same structure but different node values, so the output is `false`.
