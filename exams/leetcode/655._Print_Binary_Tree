To solve the problem of constructing a formatted layout of a binary tree in a string matrix, we need to follow the specific rules given in the problem. Here's a detailed approach to achieve this:

### Steps:

1. **Calculate the Height of the Tree**:
    - The height of the tree is the maximum depth of the tree. This can be calculated using a recursive function.

2. **Determine the Dimensions of the Matrix**:
    - The number of rows, `m`, should be `height + 1`.
    - The number of columns, `n`, should be `2^(height + 1) - 1`.

3. **Initialize the Matrix**:
    - Create an empty matrix with `m` rows and `n` columns, filled with empty strings.

4. **Place Nodes in the Matrix**:
    - Use a recursive function to place each node at the correct position.
    - The root node is placed at `res[0][(n-1)/2]`.
    - For each node placed at `res[r][c]`, place its left child at `res[r+1][c - 2^(height - r - 1)]` and its right child at `res[r+1][c + 2^(height - r - 1)]`.

### Implementation:

Here's the Python implementation for this approach:

```python
from typing import List, Optional

# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def printTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[List[str]]:
        # Function to compute the height of the tree
        def getHeight(node: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
            if not node:
                return -1
            return 1 + max(getHeight(node.left), getHeight(node.right))
        
        # Calculate height of the tree
        height = getHeight(root)
        m = height + 1
        n = (1 << (height + 1)) - 1  # equivalent to 2^(height+1) - 1
        
        # Initialize the result matrix with empty strings
        res = [["" for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]
        
        # Helper function to place nodes in the matrix
        def placeNode(node: Optional[TreeNode], r: int, c: int, level: int):
            if not node:
                return
            res[r][c] = str(node.val)
            if node.left:
                placeNode(node.left, r + 1, c - (1 << (height - r - 1)), level + 1)
            if node.right:
                placeNode(node.right, r + 1, c + (1 << (height - r - 1)), level + 1)
        
        # Place the root node in the middle of the top row
        placeNode(root, 0, (n - 1) // 2, 0)
        
        return res

# Helper function to build a tree from list
def build_tree(lst, index=0):
    if index < len(lst):
        value = lst[index]
        if value is None:
            return None
        root = TreeNode(value)
        root.left = build_tree(lst, 2 * index + 1)
        root.right = build_tree(lst, 2 * index + 2)
        return root
    return None

# Example usage
root = build_tree([1, 2])
solution = Solution()
print(solution.printTree(root))

root = build_tree([1, 2, 3, None, 4])
print(solution.printTree(root))
```

### Explanation:

1. **TreeNode Class**:
    - Defines the structure of a node in the binary tree.
    
2. **Solution Class**:
    - Contains the `printTree` method which orchestrates the overall solution.
    - `getHeight` computes the height of the tree.
    - `placeNode` places each node in its correct position in the matrix.
    
3. **Helper Function**:
    - `build_tree` constructs a binary tree from a list representation to facilitate easy testing.

### Testing:

The provided examples:
```python
# Example 1
root = build_tree([1, 2])
print(solution.printTree(root))
# Output: [["","1",""], ["2","",""]]

# Example 2
root = build_tree([1, 2, 3, None, 4])
print(solution.printTree(root))
# Output: [["","","","1","","",""], ["","2","","","","3",""], ["","","4","","","",""]]
```

This approach and implementation correctly follow the problem requirements and handle the constraints effectively.
