### 234. Palindrome Linked List

**Problem Description:**

Given the head of a singly linked list, return `true` if it is a palindrome or `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: head = [1,2,2,1]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 10^5]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 9`

**Follow-up:** Could you do it in `O(n)` time and `O(1)` space?

### Explanation (Like I'm 12):

Imagine you have a string of beads, and you want to check if the beads are the same when you look at them from the start and from the end. If they look the same, it's a palindrome. We need to do this with a linked list, which is a chain of nodes connected one after another.

### Python Solution:

Here's how you can do it:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        # Step 1: Find the middle of the linked list
        slow = fast = head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        
        # Step 2: Reverse the second half of the linked list
        prev = None
        while slow:
            next_node = slow.next
            slow.next = prev
            prev = slow
            slow = next_node
        
        # Step 3: Check palindrome
        left, right = head, prev
        while right:
            if left.val != right.val:
                return False
            left = left.next
            right = right.next
        
        return True
```

### Explanation of the Solution:

1. **Find the Middle:**
   - We use two pointers, `slow` and `fast`. `Slow` moves one step at a time, while `fast` moves two steps. By the time `fast` reaches the end, `slow` will be in the middle.

2. **Reverse the Second Half:**
   - Starting from the middle, we reverse the second half of the list. This way, we can compare the first half with the reversed second half.

3. **Check Palindrome:**
   - We compare the nodes from the start of the list and the start of the reversed second half. If all corresponding nodes are the same, the list is a palindrome.

In simpler terms, we find the middle of our list of beads, reverse the second half, and then check if the first half matches the reversed second half. If they do, it's a palindrome!
