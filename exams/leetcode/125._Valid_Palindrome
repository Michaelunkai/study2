### Problem Statement (Explained Like You're 12):

A phrase is a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward after converting all uppercase letters to lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters (letters and numbers).

For example:
- "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" becomes "amanaplanacanalpanama" and is a palindrome.
- "race a car" becomes "raceacar" and is not a palindrome.

Your job is to write a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome.

### Python Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        # Convert string to lowercase and filter out non-alphanumeric characters
        filtered_chars = [char.lower() for char in s if char.isalnum()]
        # Check if the filtered list is equal to its reverse
        return filtered_chars == filtered_chars[::-1]
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Function Signature**:
    ```python
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
    ```

2. **Filter and Lowercase**:
    ```python
    filtered_chars = [char.lower() for char in s if char.isalnum()]
    ```

    - Convert the string `s` to lowercase.
    - Filter out all non-alphanumeric characters using list comprehension.
    - `char.lower()`: Convert each character to lowercase.
    - `char.isalnum()`: Check if the character is alphanumeric (letter or number).

3. **Check Palindrome**:
    ```python
    return filtered_chars == filtered_chars[::-1]
    ```

    - Check if the filtered list of characters is equal to its reverse.
    - `filtered_chars[::-1]`: Reverse the list of filtered characters.
    - If they are equal, the string is a palindrome, so return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.

### Summary:

1. Convert the string to lowercase and filter out non-alphanumeric characters.
2. Check if the resulting string is equal to its reverse.
3. Return `True` if it is a palindrome, `False` otherwise.
