### Problem Statement (Explained Like You're 12):

You have a list of numbers, and you need to find the maximum difference between any two successive elements in the sorted form of the list. If the list has less than two elements, return 0.

For example:
- In the list `[3, 6, 9, 1]`, when sorted it becomes `[1, 3, 6, 9]`. The maximum difference between successive elements is 3 (between 6 and 9).

You need to find a solution that runs in linear time and uses linear extra space.

### Python Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def maximumGap(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums) < 2:
            return 0
        
        min_val, max_val = min(nums), max(nums)
        
        if min_val == max_val:
            return 0
        
        bucket_size = max(1, (max_val - min_val) // (len(nums) - 1))
        bucket_count = (max_val - min_val) // bucket_size + 1
        
        buckets = [{'min': float('inf'), 'max': float('-inf')} for _ in range(bucket_count)]
        
        for num in nums:
            bucket_index = (num - min_val) // bucket_size
            buckets[bucket_index]['min'] = min(buckets[bucket_index]['min'], num)
            buckets[bucket_index]['max'] = max(buckets[bucket_index]['max'], num)
        
        max_gap = 0
        prev_max = min_val
        
        for bucket in buckets:
            if bucket['min'] == float('inf'):
                continue
            max_gap = max(max_gap, bucket['min'] - prev_max)
            prev_max = bucket['max']
        
        return max_gap
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Function Signature**:
    ```python
    def maximumGap(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    ```

2. **Check Length of the List**:
    ```python
    if len(nums) < 2:
        return 0
    ```

    - If the list has fewer than 2 elements, return 0 because we can't find a gap.

3. **Find Minimum and Maximum Values**:
    ```python
    min_val, max_val = min(nums), max(nums)
    ```

    - Find the minimum and maximum values in the list.

4. **Early Return for All Identical Elements**:
    ```python
    if min_val == max_val:
        return 0
    ```

    - If all elements in the list are the same, return 0 because there can't be any gap.

5. **Calculate Bucket Size and Count**:
    ```python
    bucket_size = max(1, (max_val - min_val) // (len(nums) - 1))
    bucket_count = (max_val - min_val) // bucket_size + 1
    ```

    - Calculate the bucket size to ensure that the maximum gap will be found between buckets.
    - Calculate the number of buckets needed.

6. **Initialize Buckets**:
    ```python
    buckets = [{'min': float('inf'), 'max': float('-inf')} for _ in range(bucket_count)]
    ```

    - Initialize the buckets with `min` set to `float('inf')` and `max` set to `float('-inf')`.

7. **Distribute Numbers into Buckets**:
    ```python
    for num in nums:
        bucket_index = (num - min_val) // bucket_size
        buckets[bucket_index]['min'] = min(buckets[bucket_index]['min'], num)
        buckets[bucket_index]['max'] = max(buckets[bucket_index]['max'], num)
    ```

    - Place each number into its corresponding bucket based on its value.

8. **Calculate the Maximum Gap**:
    ```python
    max_gap = 0
    prev_max = min_val
    
    for bucket in buckets:
        if bucket['min'] == float('inf'):
            continue
        max_gap = max(max_gap, bucket['min'] - prev_max)
        prev_max = bucket['max']
    ```

    - Initialize `prev_max` with `min_val`.
    - Iterate over the buckets to find the maximum gap. Ignore empty buckets.
    - Update the `max_gap` and `prev_max` during the iteration.

9. **Return the Result**:
    ```python
    return max_gap
    ```

    - Return the calculated maximum gap.

### Summary:

1. Check if the list has fewer than two elements. If yes, return 0.
2. Find the minimum and maximum values in the list.
3. Calculate the bucket size and number of buckets needed.
4. Distribute the numbers into corresponding buckets.
5. Calculate the maximum gap by iterating over the buckets.
6. Return the maximum gap.
