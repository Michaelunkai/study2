## 176. Second Highest Salary

### Problem Statement:

Given a table `Employee` with the columns `id` and `salary`, write a SQL query to find the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, return null.

### Table: Employee
| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |

- `id` is the primary key for this table.
- Each row contains information about the salary of an employee.

### SQL Solution:

```sql
SELECT 
    MAX(salary) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM 
    Employee
WHERE 
    salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employee);
```

### Explanation of the Query:

1. **Subquery to Find the Highest Salary**:
    - The subquery `(SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employee)` finds the highest salary in the `Employee` table.

2. **Main Query to Find the Second Highest Salary**:
    - The main query selects the maximum salary that is less than the highest salary.
    - This is done by using the `MAX(salary)` function and the `WHERE` clause to filter out the highest salary.

### Example:

#### Input:
Employee table:
| id | salary |
|----|--------|
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |

#### Output:
| SecondHighestSalary |
|---------------------|
| 200                 |

If there are only two unique salaries:
| id | salary |
|----|--------|
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 100    |

#### Output:
| SecondHighestSalary |
|---------------------|
| null                |

### Summary:

- The query finds the maximum salary that is less than the highest salary to determine the second highest salary.
- If there is no second highest salary, the query will return `null`.
