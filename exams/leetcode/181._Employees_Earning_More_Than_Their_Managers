### 181. Employees Earning More Than Their Managers

Write a solution to find the employees who earn more than their managers.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example:

#### Example 1:
```
Input:
Employee table:
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| id | name  | salary | managerId |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3         |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4         |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | NULL      |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | NULL      |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+

Output:
+-------------+
| Employee    |
+-------------+
| Joe         |
+-------------+

Explanation: Joe is the only employee who earns more than his manager.
```

Here is the SQL solution for the problem:

```sql
SELECT e1.name AS Employee
FROM Employee e1
JOIN Employee e2 ON e1.managerId = e2.id
WHERE e1.salary > e2.salary;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Join Employee Table with Itself**: We perform a self-join on the Employee table where `e1.managerId` matches `e2.id`.
2. **Condition for Salary Comparison**: We compare the salaries of the employee (`e1.salary`) and their manager (`e2.salary`) to find those employees earning more than their managers.
3. **Select Employee Name**: We select the names of employees who satisfy the condition of earning more than their managers.

This query identifies all employees in the `Employee` table who earn more than their respective managers by comparing their salaries.
