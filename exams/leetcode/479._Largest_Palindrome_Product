### Problem: 479. Largest Palindrome Product

### Solution

To find the largest palindromic number that can be represented as the product of two n-digit integers, we can use a brute-force approach with some optimization. We start from the largest possible n-digit numbers and move downwards. For each pair of numbers, we check if their product is a palindrome. We continue this process until we find the largest palindrome.

### Steps

1. **Generate n-digit numbers**:
   - The largest n-digit number is `10^n - 1` and the smallest is `10^(n-1)`.

2. **Check for Palindrome**:
   - A number is a palindrome if it reads the same forward and backward.

3. **Iterate and Find the Largest Palindrome**:
   - Iterate from the largest n-digit number down to the smallest.
   - For each pair of numbers, calculate their product and check if it is a palindrome.
   - Keep track of the largest palindrome found.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Since the result can be very large, return it modulo 1337.

### Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def largestPalindrome(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 1:
            return 9
        
        upper_limit = 10**n - 1
        lower_limit = 10**(n - 1)
        max_palindrome = 0
        
        for i in range(upper_limit, lower_limit - 1, -1):
            for j in range(i, lower_limit - 1, -1):
                product = i * j
                if product <= max_palindrome:
                    break
                if str(product) == str(product)[::-1]:
                    max_palindrome = product
        
        return max_palindrome % 1337

# Example usage:
solution = Solution()
print(solution.largestPalindrome(2))  # Output: 987
print(solution.largestPalindrome(1))  # Output: 9
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**:
   - If `n` is 1, the largest palindrome is 9 (`9 * 1`).

2. **Upper and Lower Limits**:
   - Calculate the upper limit (`10^n - 1`) and the lower limit (`10^(n-1)`).

3. **Iterate and Find Palindromes**:
   - Use nested loops to iterate from the largest to the smallest n-digit numbers.
   - Calculate the product of the two numbers.
   - If the product is less than the current maximum palindrome found, break the inner loop (since further products will be smaller).
   - Check if the product is a palindrome by converting it to a string and comparing it to its reverse.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Return the largest palindrome found modulo 1337.

### Examples

- **Example 1**:
  ```plaintext
  Input: n = 2
  Output: 987
  Explanation: 99 x 91 = 9009, 9009 % 1337 = 987
  ```

- **Example 2**:
  ```plaintext
  Input: n = 1
  Output: 9
  ```

This solution efficiently finds the largest palindromic product by leveraging the properties of n-digit numbers and the nature of palindromes. The nested loop ensures that we explore all potential products while the palindrome check ensures correctness. The modulo operation ensures the result fits within the required constraints.
