### Step 1: Rewrite the Entire Question
You are given two integer arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`, which are sorted in non-decreasing order. You are also given two integers, `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.
The task is to merge `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.
The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead should be stored inside the array `nums1`. To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.
### Step 2: Explain the Entire Question Step by Step
- You are given two arrays: `nums1` and `nums2`.
- `nums1` contains `m` elements followed by `n` zeros, where `m` is the number of initial elements and `n` is the number of zeros at the end.
- `nums2` contains `n` elements.
- Your task is to merge the first `m` elements of `nums1` with all the elements of `nums2`.
- The merged result should be stored in `nums1`.

class Solution:
    def merge(self, nums1, m, nums2, n):
        i = m - 1
        j = n - 1
        k = m + n - 1
        while j >= 0:
            if i >= 0 and nums1[i] > nums2[j]:
                nums1[k] = nums1[i]
                i -= 1
            else:
                nums1[k] = nums2[j]
                j -= 1
            k -= 1

class Solution:
    def merge(self, nums1, m, nums2, n):
        i = m - 1  # Pointer for the end of actual elements in nums1
        j = n - 1  # Pointer for the end of nums2
        k = m + n - 1  # Pointer for the end of nums1 array
        while j >= 0:
            if i >= 0 and nums1[i] > nums2[j]:
                nums1[k] = nums1[i]  # Place nums1[i] at the end
                i -= 1  # Move the pointer in nums1
            else:
                nums1[k] = nums2[j]  # Place nums2[j] at the end
                j -= 1  # Move the pointer in nums2
            k -= 1  # Move the pointer for the next placement
