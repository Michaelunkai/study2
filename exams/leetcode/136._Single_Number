### Problem Statement (Explained Like You're 12):

You have a list of numbers where every number appears twice except for one number that appears only once. Your job is to find the number that appears only once.

For example, if you have the list `[2, 2, 1]`, the number `1` is the only number that appears once.

### Python Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        unique_number = 0
        for num in nums:
            unique_number ^= num
        return unique_number
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Function Signature**:
    ```python
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    ```

2. **Initialize Variable**:
    ```python
    unique_number = 0
    ```

    - Initialize `unique_number` to 0. This variable will hold the result.

3. **Iterate Over the List**:
    ```python
    for num in nums:
        unique_number ^= num
    ```

    - Loop through each number in the list.
    - Use the XOR operator (`^`) to update `unique_number`.
    - The XOR operator has a special property: `a ^ a = 0` and `a ^ 0 = a`. This means that pairs of identical numbers will cancel each other out and only the unique number will remain.

4. **Return the Result**:
    ```python
    return unique_number
    ```

    - After iterating through all the numbers, `unique_number` will contain the single number that appears only once.

### Summary:

1. Initialize `unique_number` to 0.
2. Loop through the list of numbers and update `unique_number` using the XOR operator.
3. Return `unique_number`, which will be the number that appears only once.
