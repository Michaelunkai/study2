### Solution for LeetCode Problem: 466. Count The Repetitions

```python
class Solution:
    def getMaxRepetitions(self, s1: str, n1: int, s2: str, n2: int) -> int:
        if not set(s2).issubset(set(s1)):
            return 0

        s1_count, index, s2_count = 0, 0, 0
        recall = dict()
        while s1_count < n1:
            s1_count += 1
            for char in s1:
                if char == s2[index]:
                    index += 1
                    if index == len(s2):
                        s2_count += 1
                        index = 0
            
            if index in recall:
                s1_prev, s2_prev = recall[index]
                cycle_length = s1_count - s1_prev
                cycle_s2_count = s2_count - s2_prev
                remaining_s1_count = n1 - s1_count
                cycles = remaining_s1_count // cycle_length
                s2_count += cycles * cycle_s2_count
                s1_count += cycles * cycle_length
            else:
                recall[index] = (s1_count, s2_count)

        return s2_count // n2
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initial Check**:
   - Check if all characters in `s2` are also in `s1`. If not, return 0 since it's impossible to form `s2` from `s1`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `s1_count`: Tracks the number of times `s1` has been fully iterated.
   - `index`: Tracks the current position in `s2`.
   - `s2_count`: Tracks the number of times `s2` can be formed.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The outer loop iterates over `s1` up to `n1` times.
   - For each character in `s1`, check if it matches the current character in `s2`.
   - If a match is found, move to the next character in `s2`. If the end of `s2` is reached, reset `index` and increment `s2_count`.

4. **Cycle Detection**:
   - Use a dictionary `recall` to remember the state (`index`, `s1_count`, `s2_count`).
   - If the same `index` is encountered again, a cycle is detected.
   - Calculate the cycle length and the number of `s2` patterns formed in each cycle.
   - Fast forward using the cycles to avoid redundant computation.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - Return the number of times `s2` can be formed from `str1` divided by `n2` to get the final answer.
