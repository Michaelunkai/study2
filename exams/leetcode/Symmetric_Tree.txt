### Step 1: Rewrite the Entire Question
**Problem: Symmetric Tree**
Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).
**Examples:**
Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
Output: true
Example 2:
Input: root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]
Output: false
**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
**Follow-up:** Could you solve it both recursively and iteratively?
### Step 2: Explain the Entire Question Step by Step
1. **Given a binary tree root:** You are given the root node of a binary tree.
2. **Check for symmetry:** Your task is to check if the tree is symmetric around its center.
3. **Symmetry definition:** A tree is symmetric if it is a mirror image of itself. This means the left subtree is a mirror reflection of the right subtree.
4. **Examples:**
   - Example 1: The tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric because it looks the same on both sides of its center.
   - Example 2: The tree [1,2,2,null,3,null,3] is not symmetric because the left and right subtrees are different.
5. **Constraints:**
   - There can be up to 1000 nodes in the tree.
   - Node values can range from -100 to 100.

            return False  # They are not symmetric
        return (t1.val == t2.val) and self.isMirror(t1.right, t2.left) and self.isMirror(t1.left, t2.right) 
        # Check if values are same and subtrees are mirrors
