### Problem Statement (Explained Like You're 12):

You have two numbers, a numerator and a denominator, and you need to divide them and express the result as a decimal. If the decimal repeats (like 1/3 = 0.3333...), put the repeating part in parentheses. If it doesn't repeat, just return the result as a string.

For example:
- 1 divided by 2 is 0.5.
- 2 divided by 1 is 2.
- 4 divided by 333 is 0.(012), because 0.012012012... repeats.

### Python Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def fractionToDecimal(self, numerator: int, denominator: int) -> str:
        if numerator == 0:
            return "0"
        
        result = []
        
        # If the result is negative
        if (numerator < 0) ^ (denominator < 0):
            result.append("-")
        
        numerator, denominator = abs(numerator), abs(denominator)
        
        # Append the integer part
        result.append(str(numerator // denominator))
        numerator %= denominator
        
        if numerator == 0:
            return "".join(result)
        
        result.append(".")
        
        # Dictionary to store previously seen remainders
        seen = {}
        
        while numerator != 0:
            if numerator in seen:
                result.insert(seen[numerator], "(")
                result.append(")")
                break
            
            seen[numerator] = len(result)
            numerator *= 10
            result.append(str(numerator // denominator))
            numerator %= denominator
        
        return "".join(result)
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Function Signature**:
    ```python
    def fractionToDecimal(self, numerator: int, denominator: int) -> str:
    ```

2. **Check if Numerator is Zero**:
    ```python
    if numerator == 0:
        return "0"
    ```

    - If the numerator is zero, the result is zero.

3. **Initialize Result List**:
    ```python
    result = []
    ```

    - Initialize an empty list to store parts of the result as strings.

4. **Handle Negative Result**:
    ```python
    if (numerator < 0) ^ (denominator < 0):
        result.append("-")
    ```

    - If one of the numerator or denominator is negative (but not both), append a "-" to the result.

5. **Convert Numerator and Denominator to Positive**:
    ```python
    numerator, denominator = abs(numerator), abs(denominator)
    ```

    - Convert both numerator and denominator to their absolute values.

6. **Append Integer Part**:
    ```python
    result.append(str(numerator // denominator))
    numerator %= denominator
    ```

    - Append the integer part of the division to the result.
    - Update the numerator to the remainder of the division.

7. **Check for No Remainder**:
    ```python
    if numerator == 0:
        return "".join(result)
    ```

    - If there is no remainder, return the result as a joined string.

8. **Append Decimal Point**:
    ```python
    result.append(".")
    ```

    - Append a decimal point to the result.

9. **Initialize Dictionary for Seen Remainders**:
    ```python
    seen = {}
    ```

    - Initialize a dictionary to store remainders and their positions in the result.

10. **Process Fractional Part**:
    ```python
    while numerator != 0:
        if numerator in seen:
            result.insert(seen[numerator], "(")
            result.append(")")
            break
        
        seen[numerator] = len(result)
        numerator *= 10
        result.append(str(numerator // denominator))
        numerator %= denominator
    ```

    - While there is a remainder:
        - If the remainder has been seen before, it means the decimal part is repeating. Insert "(" at the first occurrence and append ")" at the end.
        - Store the position of the current remainder.
        - Multiply the numerator by 10 and append the next digit of the fractional part to the result.
        - Update the numerator to the remainder of the division.

11. **Return the Result**:
    ```python
    return "".join(result)
    ```

    - Return the result as a joined string.

### Summary:

1. Check if the numerator is zero. If yes, return "0".
2. Initialize a result list to store parts of the result.
3. Handle the sign of the result.
4. Append the integer part of the division to the result.
5. If there is no remainder, return the result.
6. Append the decimal point to the result.
7. Use a dictionary to track remainders and their positions to detect repeating decimals.
8. Process the fractional part, handle repeating decimals if they occur.
9. Return the final result as a string.
