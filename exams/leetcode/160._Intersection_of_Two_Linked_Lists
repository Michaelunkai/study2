### Problem Statement (Explained Like You're 12):

You have two linked lists. A linked list is like a chain of nodes where each node points to the next one. Sometimes, two linked lists merge at some point, meaning they share some common nodes. Your job is to find the node where these two linked lists start to intersect (merge). If they don't intersect, return `None`.

For example, if you have:
- List A: `a1 -> a2 -> c1 -> c2 -> c3`
- List B: `b1 -> b2 -> b3 -> c1 -> c2 -> c3`
The intersection starts at node `c1`.

### Python Solution:

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.next = None

class Solution:
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA: ListNode, headB: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        if not headA or not headB:
            return None
        
        pA, pB = headA, headB
        
        while pA != pB:
            pA = pA.next if pA else headB
            pB = pB.next if pB else headA
        
        return pA
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **ListNode Class**:
    ```python
    class ListNode:
        def __init__(self, x):
            self.val = x
            self.next = None
    ```

    - This defines a node in the linked list with a value `x` and a pointer to the next node.

2. **Solution Class and Method**:
    ```python
    class Solution:
        def getIntersectionNode(self, headA: ListNode, headB: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    ```

    - Define the `getIntersectionNode` method which takes the heads of two linked lists `headA` and `headB` as input and returns the node where they intersect.

3. **Initial Check**:
    ```python
    if not headA or not headB:
        return None
    ```

    - If either of the linked lists is empty, return `None` because they cannot intersect.

4. **Two Pointers**:
    ```python
    pA, pB = headA, headB
    ```

    - Initialize two pointers, `pA` and `pB`, to the heads of the two linked lists.

5. **Traverse the Lists**:
    ```python
    while pA != pB:
        pA = pA.next if pA else headB
        pB = pB.next if pB else headA
    ```

    - Traverse both linked lists using the two pointers.
    - When `pA` reaches the end of list A, reset it to the head of list B.
    - When `pB` reaches the end of list B, reset it to the head of list A.
    - If the lists intersect, `pA` and `pB` will meet at the intersection node.
    - If the lists do not intersect, `pA` and `pB` will both eventually become `None`.

6. **Return the Result**:
    ```python
    return pA
    ```

    - Return the intersection node, or `None` if the lists do not intersect.

### Summary:

1. Check if either linked list is empty. If yes, return `None`.
2. Initialize two pointers to the heads of the two linked lists.
3. Traverse both lists using the two pointers. When a pointer reaches the end of a list, reset it to the head of the other list.
4. If the lists intersect, the pointers will meet at the intersection node. Otherwise, they will both become `None`.
5. Return the intersection node, or `None` if the lists do not intersect.
