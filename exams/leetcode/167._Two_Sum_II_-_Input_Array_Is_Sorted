### Problem Statement (Explained Like You're 12):

You have a list of numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order (which means the numbers are sorted from smallest to largest or equal). You need to find two different numbers in the list that add up to a specific target number. You should return the positions (indices) of these two numbers, but the positions are 1-based (meaning the first position is 1, the second position is 2, and so on).

For example:
- If the list is `[2, 7, 11, 15]` and the target is `9`, you should return `[1, 2]` because `2 + 7 = 9`.
- If the list is `[2, 3, 4]` and the target is `6`, you should return `[1, 3]` because `2 + 4 = 6`.

### Python Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
        
        while left < right:
            current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
            
            if current_sum == target:
                return [left + 1, right + 1]
            elif current_sum < target:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
        
        return []
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Function Signature**:
    ```python
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
    ```

2. **Initialize Two Pointers**:
    ```python
    left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
    ```

    - Initialize `left` pointer to the start of the list and `right` pointer to the end of the list.

3. **Iterate Until Pointers Meet**:
    ```python
    while left < right:
    ```

    - Loop until the `left` pointer is less than the `right` pointer.

4. **Calculate Current Sum**:
    ```python
    current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
    ```

    - Calculate the sum of the numbers at the `left` and `right` pointers.

5. **Check If Current Sum Equals Target**:
    ```python
    if current_sum == target:
        return [left + 1, right + 1]
    ```

    - If the current sum is equal to the target, return the 1-based indices of the `left` and `right` pointers.

6. **Move Pointers Based on Comparison**:
    ```python
    elif current_sum < target:
        left += 1
    else:
        right -= 1
    ```

    - If the current sum is less than the target, move the `left` pointer to the right to increase the sum.
    - If the current sum is greater than the target, move the `right` pointer to the left to decrease the sum.

7. **Return Empty List if No Solution**:
    ```python
    return []
    ```

    - If the loop ends and no solution is found, return an empty list.

### Summary:

1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, at the start and end of the list.
2. Loop until the `left` pointer is less than the `right` pointer.
3. Calculate the current sum of the numbers at the `left` and `right` pointers.
4. If the current sum equals the target, return the 1-based indices of the pointers.
5. If the current sum is less than the target, move the `left` pointer to the right.
6. If the current sum is greater than the target, move the `right` pointer to the left.
7. If no solution is found, return an empty list.
