### Solution for LeetCode Problem: 463. Island Perimeter

To determine the perimeter of an island in a given grid, we can use the following approach:

1. **Iterate Through the Grid**: Traverse each cell in the grid.
2. **Check for Land Cells**: If a cell is land (`grid[i][j] == 1`), it contributes 4 to the perimeter initially.
3. **Reduce Perimeter for Adjacent Lands**: For each land cell, check its adjacent cells (left and top). If an adjacent cell is also land, reduce the perimeter by 2 for each adjacent land cell because the shared edge reduces the perimeter by 2.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Initialization**: Start with a perimeter of 0.
2. **Grid Traversal**: Loop through each cell in the grid.
3. **Update Perimeter**:
   - For each land cell, add 4 to the perimeter.
   - If the cell above it is also land, subtract 2 from the perimeter.
   - If the cell to the left of it is also land, subtract 2 from the perimeter.

Here is the implementation in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def islandPerimeter(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        perimeter = 0
        rows = len(grid)
        cols = len(grid[0])
        
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if grid[r][c] == 1:
                    # Add 4 for each land cell
                    perimeter += 4
                    
                    # Check the cell above
                    if r > 0 and grid[r-1][c] == 1:
                        perimeter -= 2
                        
                    # Check the cell to the left
                    if c > 0 and grid[r][c-1] == 1:
                        perimeter -= 2
        
        return perimeter
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `perimeter = 0`: Initialize perimeter to 0.
   - `rows = len(grid)`: Get the number of rows in the grid.
   - `cols = len(grid[0])`: Get the number of columns in the grid.

2. **Grid Traversal**:
   - Use nested loops to traverse each cell in the grid.

3. **Update Perimeter**:
   - If the current cell is land (`grid[r][c] == 1`), increment the perimeter by 4.
   - Check if the cell above (`grid[r-1][c]`) is land and if it exists (i.e., `r > 0`). If true, decrement the perimeter by 2.
   - Check if the cell to the left (`grid[r][c-1]`) is land and if it exists (i.e., `c > 0`). If true, decrement the perimeter by 2.

### Example:

For `grid = [[0,1,0,0],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,0,0],[1,1,0,0]]`:

- Initial perimeter for each land cell (1) is 4.
- Reduce perimeter by 2 for each pair of adjacent land cells.

This method ensures that the perimeter is accurately calculated by accounting for all land cells and their shared edges.
