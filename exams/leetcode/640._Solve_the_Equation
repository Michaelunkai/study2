To solve the equation given in the form of a string, we can follow these steps:

1. **Parse the Equation**: Split the equation into the left and right parts based on the '=' sign.
2. **Collect Coefficients**: Iterate over each part (left and right) to collect the coefficients of 'x' and the constants.
3. **Simplify**: Combine the coefficients of 'x' and constants from both sides.
4. **Solve for x**: Depending on the combined coefficients, determine the solution or identify if there are no solutions or infinite solutions.

### Implementation Steps:

1. **Split the Equation**: Use the '=' to split the equation into left and right parts.
2. **Parse Terms**: For each part, parse the terms to extract coefficients of 'x' and the constants. Handle '+' and '-' signs appropriately.
3. **Combine Terms**: Combine the coefficients and constants from both sides.
4. **Check Conditions**: Determine the result based on the combined coefficients.

### Code Implementation:

Here's a Python function to solve the given equation:

```python
class Solution:
    def solveEquation(self, equation: str) -> str:
        def parse_side(side):
            sign = 1
            coefficient = 0
            constant = 0
            n = len(side)
            i = 0
            while i < n:
                if side[i] == '+':
                    sign = 1
                    i += 1
                elif side[i] == '-':
                    sign = -1
                    i += 1
                
                j = i
                while j < n and side[j] != '+' and side[j] != '-':
                    j += 1
                
                term = side[i:j]
                if 'x' in term:
                    if term == 'x':
                        coefficient += sign
                    elif term == '-x':
                        coefficient -= 1
                    else:
                        coefficient += sign * int(term[:-1])
                else:
                    constant += sign * int(term)
                i = j
            return coefficient, constant
        
        left, right = equation.split('=')
        left_coefficient, left_constant = parse_side(left)
        right_coefficient, right_constant = parse_side(right)
        
        coefficient = left_coefficient - right_coefficient
        constant = right_constant - left_constant
        
        if coefficient == 0:
            if constant == 0:
                return "Infinite solutions"
            else:
                return "No solution"
        else:
            x_value = constant // coefficient
            return f"x={x_value}"

# Example usage:
solution = Solution()
print(solution.solveEquation("x+5-3+x=6+x-2"))  # Output: "x=2"
print(solution.solveEquation("x=x"))  # Output: "Infinite solutions"
print(solution.solveEquation("2x=x"))  # Output: "x=0"
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Parsing Each Side**:
   - The `parse_side` function handles the parsing of each side of the equation. It reads through the side, identifies terms, and calculates the total coefficient of 'x' and the constant.
   - This function also handles signs and distinguishes between terms with and without 'x'.

2. **Combining Results**:
   - After parsing both sides, the coefficients and constants from the right side are subtracted from the left side to consolidate the equation into the form `ax + b = 0`.

3. **Solving for x**:
   - Depending on the consolidated coefficients and constants, the solution is determined:
     - If both the coefficient and constant are zero, there are infinite solutions.
     - If only the coefficient is zero, there are no solutions.
     - Otherwise, the value of 'x' is computed by dividing the constant by the coefficient.

This approach ensures that the equation is parsed and solved systematically, handling different edge cases correctly.
