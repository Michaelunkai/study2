### 180. Consecutive Numbers

Find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example:

#### Example 1:
```
Input:
Logs table:
+----+-----+
| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+

Output:
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+

Explanation: 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.
```

Here is the SQL solution for the problem:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT l1.num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM Logs l1, Logs l2, Logs l3
WHERE l1.num = l2.num AND l2.num = l3.num
AND l1.id = l2.id - 1 AND l2.id = l3.id - 1;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Alias the Logs Table**: We alias the Logs table as `l1`, `l2`, and `l3` to compare different rows of the same table.
2. **Condition for Consecutive Numbers**: We ensure that the `num` values of the three consecutive rows are the same and that the IDs are consecutive.
3. **Select Distinct Consecutive Numbers**: We select the distinct numbers that appear consecutively at least three times.

This query identifies all numbers in the `Logs` table that appear consecutively at least three times by comparing the `num` values of consecutive rows.
