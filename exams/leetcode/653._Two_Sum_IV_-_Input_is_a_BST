To solve the problem of finding if there exist two elements in a binary search tree (BST) such that their sum is equal to a given integer `k`, we can leverage the properties of BSTs and use a set to keep track of the values we have seen so far. Here's a detailed approach and the corresponding solution:

### Approach:
1. **Inorder Traversal**:
    - Perform an inorder traversal to leverage the sorted property of the BST. This will help in efficiently checking for the pair.
2. **Hash Set**:
    - Use a hash set to store the values we have encountered during the traversal.
    - For each node, check if `k - node.val` exists in the set. If it does, return `true`.
    - Otherwise, add the current node's value to the set and continue the traversal.
3. **Early Termination**:
    - If at any point we find such a pair, we can terminate early and return `true`.

### Implementation:

Here's the Python implementation of the above approach:

```python
from typing import Optional, Set

# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def findTarget(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], k: int) -> bool:
        def inorder(node: Optional[TreeNode], seen: Set[int]) -> bool:
            if not node:
                return False
            if inorder(node.left, seen):
                return True
            if k - node.val in seen:
                return True
            seen.add(node.val)
            return inorder(node.right, seen)
        
        seen = set()
        return inorder(root, seen)

# Helper function to build a tree from list
def build_tree(lst, index=0):
    if index < len(lst):
        value = lst[index]
        if value is None:
            return None
        root = TreeNode(value)
        root.left = build_tree(lst, 2 * index + 1)
        root.right = build_tree(lst, 2 * index + 2)
        return root
    return None

# Example usage
root = build_tree([5, 3, 6, 2, 4, None, 7])
solution = Solution()
print(solution.findTarget(root, 9))  # Output: True
print(solution.findTarget(root, 28))  # Output: False
```

### Explanation:
1. **TreeNode Class**:
    - Defines the structure of a node in the binary tree.
2. **Solution Class**:
    - Contains the `findTarget` method which initiates the process.
    - Uses an inner function `inorder` to perform an inorder traversal and check for the existence of two nodes that sum up to `k`.
3. **Helper Function**:
    - `build_tree` constructs a binary tree from a list representation to facilitate easy testing.

### Constraints Handling:
- The constraints of the problem, including the range of node values and the value of `k`, are naturally handled by the logic, as we use a set to keep track of the seen values and check for the required pair during the traversal.

This approach efficiently solves the problem with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, and a space complexity of O(n) due to the set used to store seen values.
