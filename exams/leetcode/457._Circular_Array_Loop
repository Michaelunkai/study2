### 457. Circular Array Loop

To detect a cycle in a circular array where the cycle follows the given movement rules, we can use a combination of fast and slow pointers to identify potential cycles, and then validate the cycles.

**Solution:**

```python
class Solution:
    def circularArrayLoop(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        n = len(nums)
        
        def next_index(i):
            return (i + nums[i]) % n
        
        for i in range(n):
            if nums[i] == 0:
                continue
            
            slow, fast = i, i
            direction = nums[i] > 0
            
            while True:
                slow = next_index(slow)
                fast = next_index(fast)
                if nums[fast] * nums[i] <= 0:
                    break
                fast = next_index(fast)
                if nums[fast] * nums[i] <= 0:
                    break
                
                if slow == fast:
                    if slow == next_index(slow):
                        break
                    return True
            
            slow = i
            while nums[slow] * nums[i] > 0:
                next_pos = next_index(slow)
                nums[slow] = 0
                slow = next_pos
        
        return False
```

### Explanation:

1. **Helper Function:**
   - `next_index(i)`: This function calculates the next index based on the current index `i` and the value `nums[i]`.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - Iterate through each index `i` of the array `nums`.
   - Skip the index if the value at that index is `0` (used to mark visited elements).

3. **Detect Cycle Using Fast and Slow Pointers:**
   - Initialize `slow` and `fast` pointers at the current index `i`.
   - Determine the direction (`True` for positive, `False` for negative) based on the sign of `nums[i]`.
   - Move `slow` pointer by one step and `fast` pointer by two steps in each iteration.
   - If at any point the product of the value at the current `fast` position and the value at the starting position `i` is non-positive, it means we have changed directions, so break the loop.
   - If `slow` and `fast` pointers meet, check if it's a valid cycle:
     - If `slow` is equal to the next position of `slow`, it means it's a single-element loop, so break.
     - Otherwise, a valid cycle is detected, return `True`.

4. **Mark Visited Nodes:**
   - If no cycle is found, mark all nodes in the current traversal as `0` to avoid reprocessing.

5. **Return Result:**
   - If no cycle is detected in the entire array, return `False`.

### Example Walkthrough:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `nums = [2,-1,1,2,2]`
   - Steps:
     - Start with `i = 0`, `slow = 0`, `fast = 0`
     - Move `slow` to 2, `fast` to 2
     - Move `slow` to 4, `fast` to 4
     - Move `slow` to 1, `fast` to 1
     - Move `slow` to 3, `fast` to 3
     - Move `slow` to 0, `fast` to 0
     - Cycle detected
   - Output: `True`

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5,6]`
   - Steps:
     - No valid cycle as all movements are negative and only single-element loops are found
   - Output: `False`

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `nums = [1,-1,5,1,4]`
   - Steps:
     - No valid cycle involving different directions
   - Output: `True`

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`
- `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- `nums[i] != 0`

This approach ensures that we detect cycles in \(O(n)\) time complexity and \(O(1)\) extra space complexity by using the two-pointer technique and marking visited nodes.
