## 169. Majority Element

### Problem Statement (Explained Like You're 12):

You have a list of numbers, and you need to find the number that appears more than half the time in the list. This number is called the majority element. For example:
- In the list `[3, 2, 3]`, the number `3` is the majority element because it appears twice and the length of the list is 3.
- In the list `[2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]`, the number `2` is the majority element because it appears four times and the length of the list is 7.

### Python Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        count = 0
        candidate = None
        
        for num in nums:
            if count == 0:
                candidate = num
            count += (1 if num == candidate else -1)
        
        return candidate
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Function Signature**:
    ```python
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    ```

2. **Initialize Count and Candidate**:
    ```python
    count = 0
    candidate = None
    ```

    - Initialize `count` to 0 and `candidate` to `None`.

3. **Iterate Over Each Number**:
    ```python
    for num in nums:
    ```

    - Loop through each number in the list.

4. **Set Candidate If Count is Zero**:
    ```python
    if count == 0:
        candidate = num
    ```

    - If `count` is zero, set the current number as the candidate.

5. **Update Count**:
    ```python
    count += (1 if num == candidate else -1)
    ```

    - Increase the count if the current number is the candidate, otherwise decrease the count.

6. **Return the Candidate**:
    ```python
    return candidate
    ```

    - Return the candidate, which is the majority element.

### Summary:

1. Initialize `count` to 0 and `candidate` to `None`.
2. Loop through each number in the list.
3. If `count` is zero, set the current number as the candidate.
4. Increase the count if the current number is the candidate, otherwise decrease the count.
5. Return the candidate as the majority element.
