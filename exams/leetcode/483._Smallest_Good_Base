### Problem: 483. Smallest Good Base

### Solution

The goal is to find the smallest base `k` such that the number `n` can be represented in base `k` with all digits being `1`. Given `n`, we need to find such a base `k`.

### Key Observations

1. **All 1's Representation**:
   - For a number `n` to be represented as all 1's in base `k`, it should satisfy the equation:
     ```
     n = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3 + ... + k^(m-1)
     ```
   - This is a geometric series with `m` terms.
   - Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:
     ```
     n = (k^m - 1) / (k - 1)
     ```

2. **Range of `m`**:
   - The value of `m` ranges from 2 to `log2(n+1)` because the smallest possible base is 2, and in the worst case, `n` is represented as `11` in base `n-1`.

3. **Binary Search for `k`**:
   - For each potential length `m`, use binary search to find the base `k` that satisfies the equation for the geometric series.

### Steps

1. Convert the input string `n` to an integer.
2. Iterate over potential values of `m` from the maximum possible down to 2.
3. For each `m`, use binary search to find the smallest base `k` that works.
4. Return the smallest base found.

### Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def smallestGoodBase(self, n: str) -> str:
        n = int(n)
        
        # Try m from the largest possible value down to 2
        for m in range(int(n.bit_length()), 1, -1):
            k = int(n ** (1 / (m - 1)))
            if (k ** m - 1) // (k - 1) == n:
                return str(k)
        
        # If no good base is found in the loop, return n-1 which is always valid
        return str(n - 1)

# Example usage:
solution = Solution()
print(solution.smallestGoodBase("13"))            # Output: "3"
print(solution.smallestGoodBase("4681"))          # Output: "8"
print(solution.smallestGoodBase("1000000000000000000"))  # Output: "999999999999999999"
```

### Explanation

1. **Convert String to Integer**:
   - `n = int(n)` converts the input string to an integer.

2. **Iterate over Possible Lengths**:
   - `for m in range(int(n.bit_length()), 1, -1)` iterates over potential values of `m`. `n.bit_length()` gives the number of bits required to represent `n` in binary, which is an upper bound for `m`.

3. **Binary Search for `k`**:
   - `k = int(n ** (1 / (m - 1)))` estimates the base `k`.
   - Check if the geometric series sum `(k ** m - 1) // (k - 1) == n` holds. If it does, return `str(k)`.

4. **Fallback**:
   - If no valid base `k` is found in the loop, return `n-1` which always works as the number `n` itself can be represented as `11` in base `n-1`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the smallest good base for the given integer `n`.
