### Problem Statement (Explained Like You're 12):

You're given a list of prices where each price is the price of a stock on a given day. You want to find the maximum profit you can achieve, but you are allowed to complete at most two transactions. A transaction consists of buying and then selling one share of the stock. You must sell the stock before you can buy again.

For example, if the prices are `[3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]`, you can:
- Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3) for a profit of 3.
- Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4) for a profit of 3.
- Total profit = 3 + 3 = 6.

### Python Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        if not prices:
            return 0
        
        # Initialize the variables for the first and second transactions
        first_buy = float('inf')
        first_profit = 0
        second_buy = float('inf')
        second_profit = 0
        
        for price in prices:
            # For the first transaction
            first_buy = min(first_buy, price)  # Minimum price to buy the first stock
            first_profit = max(first_profit, price - first_buy)  # Max profit from the first transaction
            
            # For the second transaction
            second_buy = min(second_buy, price - first_profit)  # Minimum effective price to buy the second stock
            second_profit = max(second_profit, price - second_buy)  # Max profit from the second transaction
        
        return second_profit
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Function Signature**:
    ```python
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
    ```

2. **Initial Check**:
    ```python
    if not prices:
        return 0
    ```

    - If the list of prices is empty, return 0 because no transactions can be made.

3. **Initialize Variables**:
    ```python
    first_buy = float('inf')
    first_profit = 0
    second_buy = float('inf')
    second_profit = 0
    ```

    - `first_buy` and `second_buy` are initialized to infinity to ensure any price will be lower.
    - `first_profit` and `second_profit` are initialized to 0.

4. **Iterate Over Prices**:
    ```python
    for price in prices:
        # For the first transaction
        first_buy = min(first_buy, price)  # Minimum price to buy the first stock
        first_profit = max(first_profit, price - first_buy)  # Max profit from the first transaction
        
        # For the second transaction
        second_buy = min(second_buy, price - first_profit)  # Minimum effective price to buy the second stock
        second_profit = max(second_profit, price - second_buy)  # Max profit from the second transaction
    ```

    - Loop through each price in the list.
    - For the first transaction:
        - Update `first_buy` to be the minimum price seen so far.
        - Update `first_profit` to be the maximum profit possible from the first transaction.
    - For the second transaction:
        - Update `second_buy` to be the minimum effective price to buy the second stock, considering the profit from the first transaction.
        - Update `second_profit` to be the maximum profit possible from the second transaction.

5. **Return the Result**:
    ```python
    return second_profit
    ```

    - After iterating through all the prices, return the maximum profit from the second transaction.

### Summary:

1. Check if the list of prices is empty.
2. Initialize variables for tracking the minimum prices and maximum profits for the first and second transactions.
3. Loop through the prices to update the minimum prices and maximum profits for both transactions.
4. Return the maximum profit achievable with at most two transactions.
