### Problem: 482. License Key Formatting

### Solution

To solve this problem, we need to reformat the given string `s` such that:
1. All characters are uppercase.
2. Groups of characters are formed with each group containing exactly `k` characters, except for the first group which may contain fewer characters but at least one.
3. Dashes are used to separate the groups.

### Steps

1. **Remove Dashes**:
   - Remove all existing dashes from the string `s`.

2. **Convert to Uppercase**:
   - Convert all characters to uppercase.

3. **Determine Grouping**:
   - Determine the size of the first group and then split the rest of the string into groups of size `k`.

4. **Form the Result**:
   - Concatenate the groups with dashes between them to form the final result.

### Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def licenseKeyFormatting(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        # Remove all dashes and convert to uppercase
        s = s.replace('-', '').upper()
        
        # The length of the first group
        first_group_len = len(s) % k
        
        # Result array to collect groups
        result = []
        
        # Add the first group if its length is greater than 0
        if first_group_len:
            result.append(s[:first_group_len])
        
        # Add the rest of the groups
        for i in range(first_group_len, len(s), k):
            result.append(s[i:i + k])
        
        # Join all parts with dashes
        return '-'.join(result)

# Example usage:
solution = Solution()
print(solution.licenseKeyFormatting("5F3Z-2e-9-w", 4))  # Output: "5F3Z-2E9W"
print(solution.licenseKeyFormatting("2-5g-3-J", 2))    # Output: "2-5G-3J"
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Remove Dashes and Convert to Uppercase**:
   - `s.replace('-', '').upper()` removes all dashes from the string and converts all characters to uppercase.

2. **Determine Length of the First Group**:
   - `first_group_len = len(s) % k` determines the length of the first group. This is the remainder when the length of `s` is divided by `k`.

3. **Form Groups**:
   - Use an empty list `result` to collect the groups.
   - If the first group length is greater than 0, add the first part of `s` up to `first_group_len` to the `result`.
   - Use a loop to add the remaining parts of `s` in groups of size `k` to the `result`.

4. **Join with Dashes**:
   - `'-'.join(result)` joins the collected groups with dashes to form the final reformatted license key.

This approach ensures that the final license key is correctly formatted according to the given constraints.
