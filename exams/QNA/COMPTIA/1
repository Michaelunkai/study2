Question 1:
What is the primary function of a computer’s BIOS?

A. To load the operating system
B. To perform a power-on self-test (POST)
C. To manage software applications
D. To handle network communication

Answer: B. To perform a power-on self-test (POST)
Explanation: The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) is responsible for initializing and testing the hardware components of the computer during the boot-up process through the power-on self-test (POST). It also provides a set of low-level routines that the operating system uses to interact with hardware.

Question 2:
Which of the following types of RAM can detect and correct errors?

A. SDRAM
B. DDR3
C. ECC
D. Non-ECC

Answer: C. ECC
Explanation: ECC (Error-Correcting Code) RAM is capable of detecting and correcting the most common kinds of internal data corruption. It is used primarily in servers where data integrity is crucial.

Question 3:
What is the purpose of the thermal compound used between the CPU and the heat sink?

A. To prevent the CPU from overheating
B. To enhance electrical conductivity
C. To improve the mechanical connection
D. To reduce noise

Answer: A. To prevent the CPU from overheating
Explanation: Thermal compound is applied between the CPU and the heat sink to improve thermal conductivity, allowing heat to transfer more efficiently from the CPU to the heat sink, thereby preventing the CPU from overheating.

Question 4:
Which of the following is a characteristic of a solid-state drive (SSD) compared to a traditional hard disk drive (HDD)?

A. Lower power consumption
B. Higher data recovery rate
C. Larger storage capacity
D. Higher rotational speed

Answer: A. Lower power consumption
Explanation: SSDs have no moving parts, which allows them to consume less power and provide faster data access speeds compared to HDDs, which have spinning disks.

Question 5:
Which of the following ports is typically used to connect an external hard drive to a computer?

A. VGA
B. HDMI
C. USB
D. RJ-45

Answer: C. USB
Explanation: USB (Universal Serial Bus) ports are commonly used to connect external hard drives and other peripheral devices to a computer due to their wide compatibility and ease of use.

Question 6:
A user reports that their laptop battery is not charging. Which of the following is the MOST likely cause?

A. Faulty RAM
B. Outdated BIOS
C. Faulty charging cable
D. Corrupted operating system

Answer: C. Faulty charging cable
Explanation: The most likely cause of a laptop battery not charging is a faulty charging cable or adapter. It's important to check the cable and power source before investigating other potential issues.

Question 7:
Which command can be used to check the integrity of a system file in Windows?

A. chkdsk
B. sfc /scannow
C. ipconfig
D. netstat

Answer: B. sfc /scannow
Explanation: The sfc /scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces corrupted files with a cached copy that is located in a compressed folder at %WinDir%\System32\dllcache.

Question 8:
In networking, what does the acronym DHCP stand for?

A. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
B. Direct Host Connection Protocol
C. Distributed Host Control Protocol
D. Data Handling and Configuration Protocol

Answer: A. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
Explanation: DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a network management protocol used to automate the process of configuring devices on IP networks, allowing them to use network services such as DNS, NTP, and any communication protocol based on UDP or TCP.

Task Example
Task: Install and configure a printer in a Windows environment.
Open the Control Panel:

Press Win + R, type control, and press Enter.
Add a Printer:

Go to "Devices and Printers" and click on "Add a printer".
Select the Printer:

If the printer is detected automatically, select it from the list. If not, choose "The printer that I want isn't listed" and follow the prompts to manually add it.
Install Printer Driver:

If Windows does not automatically find the correct driver, download the appropriate driver from the manufacturer’s website and install it.
Test the Printer:

Once the printer is installed, print a test page to ensure it is working correctly.
Configure Printer Settings:

Access printer properties to configure preferences such as paper size, print quality, and default print settings.
