Single-user mode: A troubleshooting mode in Unix-like operating systems where only one user (typically the root user) can log in. It's used for maintenance tasks, repairs, and recovery without interference from other users or services.

Telinit: A command used in Unix-like operating systems to change the system's runlevel, which determines the state and functionality of the system. It's often used for system administration tasks such as restarting or shutting down.

Systemctl: A command-line utility in systemd-based Linux distributions used to manage system services, including starting, stopping, enabling, disabling, and restarting services. It provides control over the system's state and behavior.

Pstree: A command-line utility in Unix-like operating systems used to display a hierarchical tree diagram of processes. It visually represents the parent-child relationships between processes, helping users understand process management and dependencies.

Pgrep: A command-line utility in Unix-like operating systems used to search for processes based on specified criteria, such as process name or attributes. It provides a way to find and manage processes efficiently.

Top (command): A command-line utility in Unix-like operating systems used to monitor system processes and resource usage in real-time. It displays information such as CPU, memory, and swap usage, as well as a list of active processes.

Less: A command-line text file viewer in Unix-like operating systems similar to the more command but with additional features such as backward navigation and search functionality. It allows users to view and navigate through large files comfortably.

Ps -ef: A command in Unix-like operating systems used to display information about active processes. It provides a detailed list of processes, including their PID (Process ID), status, CPU and memory usage, and command name.

Runlevel 1: A system state in Unix-like operating systems representing single-user mode or maintenance mode. It's characterized by minimal services running, allowing system administrators to perform troubleshooting and maintenance tasks.

TCP/IP: Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, the suite of communication protocols used to connect devices over the internet or a network. TCP ensures reliable data delivery, while IP handles addressing and routing.

Routing and Switching: Networking concepts involving the forwarding of data packets between devices (routing) and the efficient forwarding of data within a network (switching). Routers connect different networks, while switches connect devices within a network.

Link aggregation: A networking technique that combines multiple physical network links into a single logical link to increase bandwidth, redundancy, and fault tolerance. It enhances network performance and reliability, especially in high-demand environments.

Spoofing: A cybersecurity attack where an attacker impersonates a legitimate entity by falsifying data such as IP addresses, email addresses, or websites. It's often used to gain unauthorized access, steal information, or launch other attacks.

Hub vs Switch vs Router: Network devices with different functions. Hubs broadcast data to all connected devices, switches selectively forward data to specific devices, and routers connect multiple networks, directing data to its destination based on IP addresses.

IPv6: Internet Protocol version 6, the latest version of the IP protocol used to identify and locate devices on a network. It provides a larger address space, improved security, and better support for emerging technologies compared to IPv4.

ASCII: American Standard Code for Information Interchange, a character encoding standard used to represent text in computers and communication equipment. It assigns unique numerical codes to characters, allowing them to be stored and transmitted digitally.

CI/CD: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment, practices in software development aimed at automating and streamlining the process of integrating code changes into a shared repository (CI) and deploying code to production environments (CD) quickly and frequently.

Jenkins: An open-source automation server used for building, testing, and deploying software. It supports various programming languages and integrates with version control systems and other tools to enable continuous integration and delivery pipelines.

Versioning: The practice of assigning unique identifiers (versions) to software releases or revisions to track changes and manage updates. It helps developers and users understand the evolution of software, rollback changes, and ensure compatibility.
