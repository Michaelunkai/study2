PuTTY is often used instead of the normal SSH client for the following reasons:

1. **Windows Compatibility**: PuTTY is a dedicated SSH client for Windows, whereas native SSH support on Windows was introduced only with Windows 10's PowerShell. Older versions of Windows lacked a native SSH client.

2. **User-Friendly Interface**: PuTTY offers a graphical user interface (GUI) that makes it easier for users unfamiliar with command-line interfaces to configure and manage SSH sessions.

3. **Session Management**: PuTTY allows saving session profiles, including connection settings, port forwarding, and authentication, which can be handy for users who frequently connect to different servers.

4. **Portability**: PuTTY is lightweight and can be run as a portable application without needing installation, which is useful for users working on systems where they cannot install software.

5. **Additional Protocols**: PuTTY supports other protocols like Telnet and Serial communication, making it more versatile than a standard SSH client.

6. **Key Management**: PuTTY integrates well with PuTTYgen (for generating SSH keys) and Pageant (for SSH key management), streamlining public key authentication for SSH connections.

Despite these benefits, the native SSH client is often preferred by those comfortable with the command line, especially on Linux, macOS, and modern Windows versions.
