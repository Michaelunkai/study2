Open PowerShell as Administrator:

    Press Win + X and select "Windows PowerShell (Admin)" from the menu.

Install OpenSSH Client and Server:

    To install both the OpenSSH client and server features, you can use the following commands:

 

Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Server
Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Client

Start the SSH Server Service:

    After installation, you'll need to start the SSH server service. Use the following command:

 

Start-Service s d

Set the SSH Server Service to Start Automatically (Optional):

    If you want the SSH server service to start automatically when your Windows machine boots up, run this command:

 

    Set-Service -Name sshd -StartupType 'Automatic'

Now, you should have the OpenSSH client and server installed and running on your Windows machine. You can use an SSH client to connect to it from another machine, and you can use the OpenSSH client from PowerShell or Command Prompt for SSH connections as well.

Please make sure you are running these commands with administrator privileges.
