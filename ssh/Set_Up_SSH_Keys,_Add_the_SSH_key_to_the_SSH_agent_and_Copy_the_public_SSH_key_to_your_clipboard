 Set Up SSH Keys
To securely connect to GitLab, set up SSH keys:

Generate an SSH key pair if you don't have one already:

 
 
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
Follow the prompts to save the key (usually in ~/.ssh/id_rsa) and optionally set a passphrase.

Add the SSH key to the SSH agent:

 
 
eval "$(s -agent -s)"
s -add ~/.s /id_rsa
Copy the public SSH key to your clipboard:

 
 
cat ~/.s /id_rsa.pub
Copy the output.

Add the SSH key to your GitLab account:

In GitLab, go to "Profile" > "Settings" > "SSH Keys."
Paste the copied key into the "Key" field.
Click "Add key."
