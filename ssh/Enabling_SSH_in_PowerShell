Enabling SSH in PowerShell involves installing the OpenSSH Server feature on your Windows machine. Here are the steps to enable SSH in PowerShell:

Step 1: Check if OpenSSH is Installed
First, check if OpenSSH is already installed on your Windows machine. You can do this by running the following command in PowerShell:


Get-WindowsCapability -Online | Where-Object {$_.Name -like 'OpenSSH*'}

If OpenSSH is installed, you should see output indicating the status. If it's not installed, you can proceed to the next step.

Step 2: Install OpenSSH
To install OpenSSH, run the following command in PowerShell with administrative privileges:


Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Server

Step 3: Start the SSH Server
After installation, you need to start the SSH server. Run the following command:

Start-Service s d

Step 4: Set the SSH Server to Start Automatically
To ensure that the SSH server starts automatically with your system, run the following command:

Set-Service -Name sshd -StartupType 'Automatic'

Step 5: Allow SSH through the Windows Firewall
If you are using the Windows Firewall, you need to allow SSH traffic. Run the following command:


New-NetFirewallRule -Name sshd -DisplayName 'OpenSSH Server (sshd)' -Enabled True -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -Action Allow -LocalPort 22


Step 6: Check SSH Status
You can check the status of the SSH server by running:

Get-Service s d

If the status is "Running," then the SSH server is active.

Step 7: Test SSH Connection
Now, you can test the SSH connection to your Windows machine using an SSH client. If you're using PowerShell, you can use the following command:

s  username@localhost
