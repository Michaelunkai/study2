Generate SSH Key Pair on Your Local Machine
Open PowerShell and run the following command to generate an SSH key pair:


ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -C "your_email@example.com"
Press Enter to accept the default location (C:\Users\micha\.ssh\id_rsa). Optionally, you can set a passphrase for the key. For no passphrase, just press Enter.
Step 2: Copy the Public Key to the Remote Servers Manually


Display the contents of your public key:

type $env:USERPROFILE\.s \id_rsa.pub
Copy the output of this command to your clipboard.



ssh-rsa <public  key> <used email adress>



Log in to the remote server at 192.168.1.222 as root and set up the SSH directory:

ssh root@192.168.1.222 "mkdir -p ~/.ssh"

ssh root@192.168.1.222 "echo 'ssh-rsa <public  key> <used email adress>' >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"




Set the correct permissions for the SSH directory and the authorized_keys file:

ssh root@192.168.1.222 "chmod 700 ~/.ssh; chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
