Here’s how to use **Flameshot** effectively:

### 1. **Launch Flameshot**
   After running `flameshot &`, the Flameshot icon will appear in the system tray. If you don’t see the tray, you can initiate it via the command line:
   ```bash
   flameshot gui
   ```

### 2. **Take a Screenshot**
   - Press **PrtScn** (if mapped) or run:
     ```bash
     flameshot gui
     ```
   - Your screen will dim, and you can drag to select the area to capture.

### 3. **Annotate and Edit**
   - Use the toolbar that appears after selecting the area:
     - **Pen**: Freehand draw.
     - **Rectangle/Line/Ellipse**: Add shapes.
     - **Text**: Add labels.
     - **Blur**: Obscure sensitive areas.
     - **Undo/Redo**: Adjust edits.

### 4. **Save or Copy**
   - Click the **Save** button to store the screenshot.
   - Use the **Copy to Clipboard** button to paste the screenshot directly into documents or chats.

### 5. **Access Settings**
   - Open the configuration dialog to adjust shortcuts or default save paths:
     ```bash
     flameshot config
     ```

**Note**: Flameshot may require additional setup to access GUI apps in WSL2. Ensure an X server like **VcXsrv** is installed and running on your Windows host.
