 Modifying Scheduled Tasks
To modify a scheduled task, you typically retrieve it, modify the desired property, and then set it again.

Retrieve the Task
 
 
$task = Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName "MyTask"
Modify the Task
For example, to change the trigger:

 
 
$trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Daily -At 8am
Set-ScheduledTask -TaskName "MyTask" -Trigger $trigger
Or to change the action:

 
 
$action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute "calc.exe"
Set-ScheduledTask -TaskName "MyTask" -Action $action
