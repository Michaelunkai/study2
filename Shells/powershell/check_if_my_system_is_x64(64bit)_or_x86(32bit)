You can use the following PowerShell command to determine if your PC is running a 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64) version of Windows:


[System.Environment]::Is64BitOperatingSystem

This command will return `True` if your system is 64-bit and `False` if it is 32-bit. Please note that you need to run this command in a PowerShell window.
