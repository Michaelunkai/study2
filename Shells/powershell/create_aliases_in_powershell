Open PowerShell: Start PowerShell by searching for it in the Start menu or pressing Win + X and selecting "Windows PowerShell."

Check if Profile Exists: Check if your PowerShell profile script exists by running:

 
 
Test-Path $PROFILE
If it returns True, your profile script exists. If it returns False, you'll need to create it.

Create Profile Script: If the profile script doesn't exist, create it by running:

 
 
New-Item -Path $PROFILE -Type File -Force
Edit Profile Script: Open the profile script in a text editor. You can use notepad to edit it:

 
 
notepad $PROFILE
Add Alias: Add the following function to your profile script to create the alias:

 
 
function 10sec {
      C:\study\Credentials\apps\WallpaperChanger\10sec.py
}
Save and Close: Save the profile script and close the text editor.

Reload Profile: To apply the changes without restarting PowerShell, reload the profile script by running:

 
 
. $PROFILE
Now, you should be able to type 10sec in PowerShell to run your Python script.
