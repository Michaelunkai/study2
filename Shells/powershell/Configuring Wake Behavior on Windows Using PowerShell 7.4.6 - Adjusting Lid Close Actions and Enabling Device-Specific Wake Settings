# Comprehensive Tutorial: Configuring Wake Behavior on Windows Using PowerShell 7.4.6 - Adjusting Lid Close Actions and Enabling Device-Specific Wake Settings

This tutorial guides you through configuring your Windows system's wake behavior using **PowerShell 7.4.6**. You will learn how to:
1. Adjust lid close actions.
2. Ensure the system remains in sleep mode when the lid is reopened.
3. Enable specific devices (e.g., keyboard) to wake the system from sleep.

---

## Prerequisites
- Windows operating system.
- PowerShell 7.4.6 installed.
- Administrative privileges for executing commands.

---

## Step 1: Configure Lid Close Action to "Do Nothing"
The first step is to ensure that closing the lid while the system is running does not put the system to sleep or hibernate.

### PowerShell Command
Run this command in an elevated PowerShell session:
```powershell
powercfg -SETACVALUEINDEX SCHEME_CURRENT SUB_BUTTONS LIDACTION 0; powercfg -SETDCVALUEINDEX SCHEME_CURRENT SUB_BUTTONS LIDACTION 0; powercfg -S SCHEME_CURRENT
```

### What This Does:
- `SETACVALUEINDEX`: Configures the "lid close action" for AC power (plugged in) to "Do nothing."
- `SETDCVALUEINDEX`: Configures the "lid close action" for battery power to "Do nothing."
- `SCHEME_CURRENT`: Applies the settings to the currently active power scheme.

## Step 2: Identify Wake-Capable Devices
To configure specific devices to wake the system, identify which devices are wake-capable.

### PowerShell Commands
1. Check devices currently set to wake the system:
   ```powershell
   powercfg -devicequery wake_armed
   ```

   - If the result is `NONE`, no devices are currently armed to wake the system.

2. List devices that *can* be configured to wake the system:
   ```powershell
   powercfg -devicequery wake_programmable
   ```

   - Review the output for devices like `HID-compliant keyboard` or similar entries.

---

## Step 3: Enable Specific Devices to Wake the System
Once you've identified the wake-capable device, enable it for wake functionality.

### Example PowerShell Commands
If you see devices like `HID-compliant vendor-defined device (001)` or `ASUS Precision Touchpad`, you can test enabling wake for these devices:

```powershell
powercfg -deviceenablewake "HID-compliant vendor-defined device (001)"
powercfg -deviceenablewake "HID-compliant vendor-defined device (003)"
```

Replace the device name with the exact name from the `wake_programmable` query.

---

## Step 4: Verify Wake Settings
After enabling wake for a device, verify that it is now configured to wake the system.

### PowerShell Command
```powershell
powercfg -devicequery wake_armed
```

If the device appears in the output, it is successfully armed for wake functionality.

---

## Step 5: Combine All Steps into a Single One-Liner
Once you've identified the correct device, combine all the steps into a single command for convenience:

### PowerShell One-Liner
```powershell
powercfg -SETACVALUEINDEX SCHEME_CURRENT SUB_BUTTONS LIDACTION 0; powercfg -SETDCVALUEINDEX SCHEME_CURRENT SUB_BUTTONS LIDACTION 0; powercfg -S SCHEME_CURRENT; powercfg -deviceenablewake "HID-compliant vendor-defined device (001)"
```

Replace `"HID-compliant vendor-defined device (001)"` with the correct device name if different.

---

## Step 6: Test the Configuration
1. Put your system to sleep using the Start menu or the `Sleep` function key.
2. Close the lid.
3. Reopen the lid. The system should remain in sleep mode.
4. Press a key on the keyboard or another enabled wake device to wake the system.

---

## Troubleshooting
- If no devices appear in `wake_programmable`, ensure your device supports wake functionality.
- If the keyboard is not listed, try updating your device drivers.
- Run all commands with administrative privileges.

This configuration ensures that your laptop behaves as desired, staying in sleep mode when the lid is reopened and only waking when a specific device (like the keyboard) is triggered.
