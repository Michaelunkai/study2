Creating Scheduled Tasks
To create a scheduled task, you need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Define the Action
The action specifies what the scheduled task will do. For example, you might want to run a script or an application.

 
 
$action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute "notepad.exe"
Step 2: Define the Trigger
The trigger specifies when the task will run. For example, you might want it to run daily at a specific time.

 
 
$trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Daily -At 7am
Step 3: Define the Principal
The principal specifies the user account under which the task will run.

 
 
$principal = New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal -UserId "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" -LogonType ServiceAccount
Step 4: Create the Task
Now, combine these components to create the task.

 
 
Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName "MyTask" -Action $action -Trigger $trigger -Principal $principal
