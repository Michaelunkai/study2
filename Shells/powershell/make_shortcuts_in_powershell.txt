    Open your PowerShell profile:
notepad $PROFILE
    Add the following function to the profile:
function Start-UbuntuVM {
    & "D:\vmwarepro\vmrun.exe" start "E:\vmware\ubuntu\Ubuntu_23.04_VM_LinuxVMImages.COM.vmx"
}
Set-Alias -Name ubu -Value Start-UbuntuVM
    Save and close the profile.
    Reload the profile:
. $PROFILE
Now, you should be able to use the ubu alias to start your Ubuntu virtual machine. PowerShell functions are more suited for this purpose as they allow for better handling of parameters and commands.
Try running ubu again, and it should execute the specified vmrun command.
