Modifying a User Account
To modify a user account, use the Set-LocalUser cmdlet. Here’s an example:

Changing the Password:
 
 
# Define the new password
$newPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString "N3wP@ssw0rd123" -AsPlainText -Force

# Set the new password
Set-LocalUser -Name $username -Password $newPassword
Changing the Full Name and Description:
 
 
Set-LocalUser -Name $username -FullName "Updated User" -Description "Updated description"
Deleting a User Account
To delete a user account, use the Remove-LocalUser cmdlet. Here’s an example:

Deleting a User Account:
 
 
Remove-LocalUser -Name $username
Example Script
Here’s a complete script that demonstrates creating a user, modifying their details, and then deleting the user:

 
 
# Define the username and password
$username = "NewUser"
$password = ConvertTo-SecureString "P@ssw0rd123" -AsPlainText -Force

# Create the user account
New-LocalUser -Name $username -Password $password -FullName "New User" -Description "Description of the new user" -AccountNeverExpires

# Add the user to the Administrators group
Add-LocalGroupMember -Group "Administrators" -Member $username

# Change the password
$newPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString "N3wP@ssw0rd123" -AsPlainText -Force
Set-LocalUser -Name $username -Password $newPassword

# Change the full name and description
Set-LocalUser -Name $username -FullName "Updated User" -Description "Updated description"

# Delete the user account
Remove-LocalUser -Name $username
