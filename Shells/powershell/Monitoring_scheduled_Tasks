 Monitoring Scheduled Tasks
To monitor scheduled tasks, you can query the status and details of the tasks.

Get All Scheduled Tasks
 
 
Get-ScheduledTask
Get Detailed Information About a Specific Task
 
 
Get-ScheduledTaskInfo -TaskName "MyTask"
Check the Last Run Result
This shows the last run result of the task:

 
 
$task = Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName "MyTask"
$task.LastTaskResult
Check the Next Run Time
This shows the next time the task is scheduled to run:

 
 
$task = Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName "MyTask"
$task.Triggers | Select-Object -ExpandProperty StartBoundary
Example Scenario
Letâ€™s say you want to create a scheduled task that runs a PowerShell script every day at 6 PM, modify it to run at 7 PM instead, and then monitor its status.

Create the Task
 
 
$action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute "powershell.exe" -Argument "C:\Scripts\MyScript.ps1"
$trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Daily -At 6pm
$principal = New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal -UserId "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" -LogonType ServiceAccount

Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName "RunMyScript" -Action $action -Trigger $trigger -Principal $principal
Modify the Task to Run at 7 PM
 
 
$trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Daily -At 7pm
Set-ScheduledTask -TaskName "RunMyScript" -Trigger $trigger
Monitor the Task
 
 
Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName "RunMyScript"
Get-ScheduledTaskInfo -TaskName "RunMyScript"
By following these steps, you can create, modify, and monitor scheduled tasks on a Windows Server using PowerShell effectively.
