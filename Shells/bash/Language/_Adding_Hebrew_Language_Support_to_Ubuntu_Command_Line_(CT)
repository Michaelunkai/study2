Step 1: Update Your Package Lists
Before making any changes, ensure that your package lists are up-to-date.

 
 
sudo apt update
Step 2: Install the Hebrew Language Pack
Install the necessary language pack for Hebrew:

 
 
sudo apt install language-pack-he
Step 3: Configure the Language Settings
Configure the locale settings to include Hebrew:

 
 
sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
Scroll down and select the Hebrew locale (he_IL.UTF-8 UTF-8) using the space bar.
Press Enter to confirm.
Choose the default locale for the system (you can select Hebrew if desired).
Step 4: Fix Ownership of /etc/sudoers.d Directory and Files
4.1 Change Ownership of /etc/sudoers.d Directory
Ensure the /etc/sudoers.d directory is owned by root:

 
 
sudo chown root:root /etc/sudoers.d
4.2 Change Ownership of Files Inside /etc/sudoers.d
Correct the ownership of the README file and any other files inside the /etc/sudoers.d directory:

 
 
sudo chown root:root /etc/sudoers.d/*
4.3 Verify the Ownership
Check that all files in the /etc/sudoers.d directory are now owned by root:

 
 
ls -l /etc/sudoers.d/
Ensure that the output shows root root as the owner and group for all files.

Step 5: Apply the Hebrew Locale
With the ownership corrected, you can now set the Hebrew locale:

 
 
sudo update-locale LANG=he_IL.UTF-8
Step 6: Reboot the System
Reboot your system to apply the changes:

 
 
sudo reboot
After rebooting, Hebrew language support should be successfully enabled on your Ubuntu Command Line (CT).
