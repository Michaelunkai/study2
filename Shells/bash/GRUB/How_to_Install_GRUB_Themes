How to Install GRUB Themes
Install a New Theme
Find and download a theme Browse
Run the following commands in a terminal window:
# change to ~/Downloads directory
cd ~/Downloads
# list the contents of the directory
ls
# extract the downloaded theme, replace the file name as needed
tar xzvf 'Grub2-theme CyberRe 1.0.0.tar.gz'
# copy the extracted theme to /boot/grub/themes
# change the theme name as needed
sudo cp CyberRe\ 1.0.0/CyberRe /boot/grub/themes/ -r
# backup /etc/default/grub
sudo cp /etc/default/grub /etc/default/grub.bkup
# edit /etc/default/grub
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
At the bottom of the file, paste the following, updating the path to the theme.txt file
GRUB_THEME=/boot/grub/themes/CyberRe/theme.txt

Press CTRL+O, Enter, CTRL+X to write the changes
Continue with the following commands in a terminal window:
# update grub
sudo update-grub
If everything is setup correctly, a line that reads Found theme: /boot/grub/themes/CyberRe/theme.txt should show in the update-grub output
Reboot to see the new theme in action
Removing the Theme
Run the following commands in a terminal window:
# change to the grub themes directory
cd /boot/grub/themes/
# list the contents of the directory
ls
# recursively remove the custom theme directory
# replace the theme folder name as needed
sudo rm CyberRe -r
NOTE: You can also remove the GRUB_THEME= line from /etc/default/grub, but it is not required
Continue with the following commands:
# update grub
sudo update-grub
# reboot
sudo reboot now
