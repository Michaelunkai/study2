nano ~/. rc


Look for the function we added. It should look like this:


command_not_found_handle() {
    if [[ "$1" == *"."* ]]; then
        nano "$*"
    else
        echo "$1: command not found"
        return 127
    fi
}

Make sure the function ends with fi instead of }. The fi closes the if statement, and the } closes the function.
Also, ensure there are no extra closing braces or parentheses.
Save the file and exit (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter).
Try to reload your bash configuration:

source ~/. rc
