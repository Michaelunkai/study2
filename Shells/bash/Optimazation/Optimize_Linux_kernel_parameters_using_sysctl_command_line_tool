View Current Kernel Parameters:
First, let's see the current kernel parameters to identify what needs optimization.

 
 
sysctl -a
Memory Management Optimization:

Increase the maximum amount of memory allocated to TCP buffers.

 
 
sudo sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=16777216
sudo sysctl -w net.core.wmem_max=16777216
Adjust swappiness to control how often the system swaps data to disk.

 
 
sudo sysctl -w vm.swappiness=10
Optimize the cache pressure.

 
 
sudo sysctl -w vm.vfs_cache_pressure=50
Networking Optimization:

Increase the maximum number of open file handles.

 
 
sudo sysctl -w fs.file-max=100000
Adjust TCP keepalive settings to release resources quickly.

 
 
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time=300
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_intvl=30
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_probes=5
Disk I/O Optimization:

Increase the I/O request queue size for better disk I/O performance.

 
 
sudo sysctl -w fs.aio-max-nr=1048576
Increase the number of inotify watchers to handle file system events.

 
 
sudo sysctl -w fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288
Apply Changes Immediately:
To apply changes immediately without rebooting.

 
 
sudo sysctl --system
Verify Changes:
After applying changes, verify if they are effective.

 
 
sysctl -a
Remember, tweaking kernel parameters can impact system stability. Ensure you understand the implications of each change and monitor system performance after optimization. Additionally, changes made with sysctl are not persistent across reboots unless configured in /etc/sysctl.conf or a file in /etc/sysctl.d/.
