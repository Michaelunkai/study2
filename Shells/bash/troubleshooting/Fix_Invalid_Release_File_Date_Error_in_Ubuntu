Step 2: Update the Date and Time Manually
If the date and time are incorrect, you can set them manually using the date command. For example, to set the date to June 3, 2024, 15:30 (3:30 PM), you would run:

It's recommended to use NTP to automatically keep your system time synchronized. Install NTP with the following commands:

apt install ntp
Step 4: Enable and Start the NTP Service
After installing NTP, enable and start the service to ensure your time stays updated:

systemctl enable ntp
systemctl start ntp
Step 5: Verify NTP Synchronization
Check the status of the NTP service to ensure it is running and synchronized:

ntpq -p
Step 6: Retry the Update
Once your date and time are correct, try running the update command again:

apt update
Following these steps should resolve the issue with the invalid release file date and allow you to update your package lists correctly.
