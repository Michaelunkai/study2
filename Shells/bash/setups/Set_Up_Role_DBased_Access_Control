Implement Data Access Controls
Ensure strict access controls to sensitive data.

Set Up Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Use the setfacl command to manage file access:

# Grant read access to a group
sudo setfacl -m g:groupname:r /path/to/file

# Grant write access to a user
sudo setfacl -m u:username:w /path/to/file
