Manually Set CPU Frequencies (Optional)
If you prefer to set specific CPU frequencies rather than using governors:

Find Available Frequencies:

 
 
cpufreq-info | grep "available frequency"
Example  :

arduino
 
available frequency steps: 800 MHz, 1.200 GHz, 1.600 GHz, 2.000 GHz, 2.400 GHz, 2.800 GHz, 3.200 GHz
Set a Specific Frequency:

To set the CPU to 1.6 GHz:

 
 
sudo cpufreq-set -r -f 1.6GHz
Verify the Change:

 
 
cpufreq-info
Confirm that the CPU is running at the specified frequency.
