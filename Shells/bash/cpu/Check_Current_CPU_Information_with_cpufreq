Check Current CPU Information
First, verify your CPU's current frequency and available scaling governors.

Open Terminal: Press Ctrl + Alt + T to open the Terminal.

Install cpufrequtils: This utility helps manage CPU frequency scaling.

 
 
sudo apt update
sudo apt install cpufrequtils
Check Current CPU Frequency:

 
 
cpufreq-info
This command displays information about CPU frequency scaling, including available governors and current settings.

Example  :

 
 
analyzing CPU 0:
  driver: acpi-cpufreq
  CPUs which run at the same frequency: 0
  CPU0 current policy: frequency should be within 800 MHz and 3.00 GHz.
                  The governor "ondemand" is active.
                  Current CPU frequency is 2.50 GHz.
