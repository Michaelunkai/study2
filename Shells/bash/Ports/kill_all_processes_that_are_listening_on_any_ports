List all processes listening on any port using lsof.
Extract the process IDs.
Kill those processes.
Here is the command to accomplish this:

 
 
kill $(lsof -t -i)
If you need to force kill all these processes, you can use the -9 option:

 
 
kill -9 $(lsof -t -i)
Please note that this will terminate all processes that are using any network ports, which could include critical system services and connections. Use this command with caution.
