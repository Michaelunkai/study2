### How to Automatically Set Execute Permissions on New Files Created with Nano in Ubuntu

In this tutorial, we will create a custom command to streamline the process of creating new executable files and opening them with Nano in Ubuntu. Follow these steps to set up the custom command.

#### Step 1: Create a Custom Command Script

First, we will create a custom script named `nanox` that will create a new file, set the execute permission, and open the file with Nano.

1. Open a terminal.
2. Create the `nanox` script in the `/usr/local/bin` directory.

     
   sudo nano /usr/local/bin/nanox

3. Add the following content to the `nanox` script:

     
   #!/bin/ 
   touch "$1"  # Create the file
   chmod +x "$1"  # Set the execute permission
   nano "$1"  # Open the file with Nano

4. Save and close the file by pressing `Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, and `Ctrl+X`.

#### Step 2: Make the Custom Command Executable

Next, we will make the `nanox` script executable.

1. Run the following command in the terminal:

     
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/nanox

#### Step 3: Update Your Bash Profile

To ensure the new command is available in your shell, add the directory containing the script to your PATH. This step might be necessary if `/usr/local/bin` is not already in your PATH.

1. Open your `~/.bashrc` file.

     
   nano ~/. rc

2. Add the following line at the end of the file:

     
   export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin

3. Save and close the file by pressing `Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, and `Ctrl+X`.

4. Reload the `~/.bashrc` file to apply the changes.

     
   source ~/. rc

#### Step 4: Using the New Command

Now, whenever you want to create a new file with Nano and set the execute permission, you can use the `nanox` command.

1. Open a terminal.
2. Run the `nanox` command with the desired filename.

     
   nanox new_script. 

This command will create `new_script.sh`, set the execute permission, and open it with Nano, all in one step.
