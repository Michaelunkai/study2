#make  ortcut permenant 


To make an alias persist after a reboot, you need to add it to your shell's configuration file. The specific file you should edit depends on the shell you're using. For most Linux distributions, if you're using the Bash shell, you should add the alias to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile file. Here's how to do it:


nano ~/. rc

Add your alias to the file. In this case, you want to add the line:



alias kalivm='vmplayer /media/micha/e/vmware/KaliLinux_2022.1_VM/KaliLinux_2022.1_VM_LinuxVMImages.COM.vmx'

Place this line at the end of the file.

Save the file and exit the text editor. In nano, you can do this by pressing Ctrl + O, then press Enter to confirm, and then Ctrl + X to exit.

To apply the changes immediately, you can either open a new terminal or run:



    source ~/. rc

Now, your alias kalivm will be available every time you open a terminal session, and it will persist across reboots.

Please note that if you're using a shell other than Bash (e.g., Zsh), you should add the alias to the appropriate configuration file for that shell (e.g., ~/.zshrc for Zsh).









#not permenant




alias kalivm='vmplayer /media/micha/e/vmware/KaliLinux_2022.1_VM/KaliLinux_2022.1_VM_LinuxVMImages.COM.vmx'

#You can replace kalivm with any alias name you prefer.

Save the file and exit the text editor.

#Reload your shell configuration to apply the changes:



source ~/. rc

Now, you can use the shortened alias to launch your Kali Linux virtual machine:



    kalivm

This way, you can execute the command with a shorter alias, saving you some typing.
