Cilium is an open-source networking and security project designed to provide visibility, security, and control for cloud-native applications running in Kubernetes and other container orchestration platforms. It uses **eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter)**, a powerful technology in the Linux kernel, to perform highly efficient networking, load balancing, and security enforcement at the kernel level. 

Key features of Cilium include:

- **Networking for Kubernetes**: Cilium provides advanced networking features like load balancing, IP routing, and overlay networks for containers.
- **Network Security**: It enforces network policies and security rules using eBPF, enabling security enforcement at the service level with minimal overhead.
- **Service Mesh**: Cilium can act as a lightweight service mesh, integrating with Envoy and providing observability and security features without requiring sidecar proxies.
- **Observability**: It offers deep visibility into the networking behavior of applications by tracing requests and network flows between containers and services.
- **Scalability**: Due to its reliance on eBPF, Cilium can scale better than traditional methods that rely on iptables for packet filtering and routing.

Cilium is widely used in Kubernetes environments to ensure efficient and secure networking at scale.
