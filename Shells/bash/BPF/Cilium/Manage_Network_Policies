Manage Network Policies
You can apply Cilium network policies to control the flow of traffic between services. Hereâ€™s an example of creating a simple policy that only allows communication between certain pods:

Create a file network-policy.yaml with this content:

 
 
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-to-specific-pod
spec:
  endpointSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: frontend
  ingress:
  - fromEndpoints:
    - matchLabels:
        app: backend
Apply the policy with:

 
 
kubectl apply -f network-policy.yaml
This will enforce that only pods labeled as backend can communicate with the frontend pods.
