The tool described is a **Scrum Board application**, which is used for managing tasks in a Scrum methodology, commonly applied in software development. Here's a summary of its features and components:

- **Scrum Board**: Visualizes tasks in three columns: TODO, InProgress, and Done.
- **Dockerized application**: The entire system runs within Docker containers, which makes deployment and setup simpler.
  
  The components include:
  - **PostgreSQL Database**: Stores tasks in a `scrum` database.
  - **Java Backend (Spring Boot)**: Provides RESTful API endpoints to interact with the tasks and scrums.
  - **Angular Frontend**: A user interface to manage tasks on the Scrum Board.

To run the application:
1. Install **Docker** and **Docker Compose**.
2. Use the command `$ docker-compose up -d` to start it.
3. The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:4200/`, and the API documentation (Swagger UI) at `http://localhost:8080/api/swagger-ui.html`.

It's a tool designed for managing Scrum workflows with a simple interface, containerized for easy setup.
