# Comprehensive Guide to Implementing Secret Management with Doppler on Ubuntu

### What is Doppler?

Doppler is a secure and centralized secret management tool designed to manage and organize environment variables and secrets across various environments, making it easier for developers to keep their applications secure and compliant.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Implementing Secret Management with Doppler on Ubuntu

### Step 1: Install Doppler CLI

1. **Update Your Package List:**

   Open a terminal and update your package list:

     
   sudo apt update

2. **Install Doppler CLI:**

   Download and install the Doppler CLI:

     
   curl -Ls https://cli.doppler.com/install.sh | sudo sh

3. **Verify the Installation:**

   Check if Doppler CLI is installed correctly:

     
   doppler --version

### Step 2: Create a Doppler Account and Project

1. **Sign Up for Doppler:**

   Go to [Doppler's website](https://doppler.com) and sign up for an account.

2. **Create a New Project:**

   After signing up, create a new project in the Doppler dashboard. Name your project and set up an environment (e.g., development, production).

### Step 3: Configure Doppler CLI

1. **Authenticate the Doppler CLI:**

   In your terminal, run the following command to authenticate the Doppler CLI:

     
   doppler login

   Follow the instructions to log in.

2. **Set Up Your Doppler Project and Config:**

   Link your local environment to the Doppler project and config you created:

     
   doppler setup

   Select your project and the environment config (e.g., development).

### Step 4: Add Secrets to Doppler

1. **Add Secrets in Doppler Dashboard:**

   Go to your Doppler project in the web dashboard. Navigate to the secrets section and add the secrets you need (e.g., API keys, database credentials).

### Step 5: Access Secrets Locally

1. **Fetch Secrets Using Doppler CLI:**

   You can fetch secrets from Doppler to your local environment using the following command:

     
   doppler secrets

2. **Use Secrets in Your Application:**

   You can integrate Doppler into your application by using environment variables. For example, if you are using Python, you can access the secrets like this:

     
   import os

   api_key = os.getenv('API_KEY')
   db_password = os.getenv('DB_PASSWORD')

### Step 6: Automate Secret Injection

1. **Run Your Application with Doppler:**

   Instead of manually fetching secrets, you can run your application with Doppler to automatically inject the secrets as environment variables:

     
   doppler run -- <your_command_here>

   For example, if you have a Python application:

     
   doppler run -- python app.py

### Step 7: CI/CD Integration

1. **Set Up Doppler in Your CI/CD Pipeline:**

   If you're using a CI/CD tool like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI, you can integrate Doppler to manage secrets in your pipeline. Refer to the [Doppler documentation](https://docs.doppler.com/docs/ci-cd-integrations) for detailed instructions on how to integrate Doppler with your specific CI/CD tool.

### Conclusion

You have now set up Doppler for secret management on Ubuntu. This setup ensures that your secrets are securely managed and easily accessible across different environments. If you have any specific questions or run into issues, feel free to ask for further assistance.
