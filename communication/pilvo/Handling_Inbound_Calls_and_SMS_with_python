Handling Inbound Calls and SMS
To handle inbound calls and SMS, you need a web server. This example uses Flask to set up a basic server for handling inbound SMS.

Setting Up a Flask Server for Inbound SMS
Install Flask:

 
 
pip3 install Flask
Create a file named app.py.

Open app.py in a text editor and add the following code:

 
 
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/sms", methods=['POST'])
def sms():
    from_number = request.form.get('From')
    to_number = request.form.get('To')
    text = request.form.get('Text')
    print(f"Received SMS from {from_number} to {to_number}: {text}")
    return "OK"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
Run the Flask server:

 
 
 3 app.py
In the Plivo dashboard, configure your Plivo number to send incoming SMS to http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:5000/sms.
