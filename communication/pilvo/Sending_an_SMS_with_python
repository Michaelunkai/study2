Sending an SMS
Create a file named send_sms.py.

Open send_sms.py in a text editor and add the following code:

 
 
import plivo

# Your Auth ID and Auth Token
auth_id = "YOUR_AUTH_ID"
auth_token = "YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN"

client = plivo.RestClient(auth_id, auth_token)

# The phone number to which you want to send the SMS
destination_number = "DESTINATION_PHONE_NUMBER"
# The phone number from which the SMS will be sent (must be a Plivo number)
source_number = "YOUR_PLIVO_NUMBER"
# The SMS text message
message = "Hello from Plivo!"

# Send the SMS
response = client.messages.create(
    src=source_number,
    dst=destination_number,
    text=message
)

print(f"Message UUID: {response['message_uuid']}")
Replace YOUR_AUTH_ID, YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN, DESTINATION_PHONE_NUMBER, and YOUR_PLIVO_NUMBER with the appropriate values.

Run the script:
