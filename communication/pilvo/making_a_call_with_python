Making a Call
Create a file named make_call.py.

Open make_call.py in a text editor and add the following code:

 
 
import plivo

# Your Auth ID and Auth Token
auth_id = "YOUR_AUTH_ID"
auth_token = "YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN"

client = plivo.RestClient(auth_id, auth_token)

# The phone number to which you want to make the call
destination_number = "DESTINATION_PHONE_NUMBER"
# The phone number from which the call will be made (must be a Plivo number)
source_number = "YOUR_PLIVO_NUMBER"
# The URL that will handle the call logic
answer_url = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.plivo.com/answer.xml"

# Make the call
response = client.calls.create(
    from_=source_number,
    to_=destination_number,
    answer_url=answer_url
)

print(f"Call UUID: {response['call_uuid']}")
Replace YOUR_AUTH_ID, YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN, DESTINATION_PHONE_NUMBER, YOUR_PLIVO_NUMBER, and answer_url with the appropriate values.

Run the script:
