**Jami** is a free, open-source communication platform that offers decentralized and secure messaging, voice, video calls, and file sharing. It emphasizes privacy by not relying on centralized servers, instead using a distributed network where each user acts as a node. This decentralized approach ensures that users' data is not stored on any central server, making it more secure against potential breaches.

Key features of Jami include:

- **Privacy and Security**: Jami uses end-to-end encryption for all communications, ensuring that only the intended recipients can access the content.
- **No Central Servers**: Jami operates without central servers, meaning that users' data is not stored or controlled by any single entity.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: It is available on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS.
- **File Sharing**: Users can securely share files of any size directly with each other.
- **Video Conferencing**: Jami supports high-quality video calls and conferencing, making it a viable alternative to other video communication tools.

Jami is often chosen by individuals and organizations that prioritize privacy and security in their communications. It can be used for personal conversations, business meetings, or any scenario where secure communication is necessary.
