 Create a Python Script for Sending SMS
Create a Python script named send_sms.py that will use the Telnyx API to send SMS messages. Open your text editor and add the following code:

 
 
import telnyx

# Replace with your Telnyx API key
telnyx.api_key = "YOUR_TELNYX_API_KEY"

response = telnyx.Message.create(
    from_="+YOUR_TELNYX_PHONE_NUMBER",  # Your Telnyx phone number
    to="+RECIPIENT_PHONE_NUMBER",       # The recipient's phone number
    text="Hello from Telnyx!"
)

print(response)
Replace "YOUR_TELNYX_API_KEY", "+YOUR_TELNYX_PHONE_NUMBER", and "+RECIPIENT_PHONE_NUMBER" with your actual Telnyx API key, your Telnyx phone number, and the recipient's phone number, respectively.

5. Run the SMS Sending Script
