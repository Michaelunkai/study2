### Step-by-Step Guide to Set Up, Run, and Use Sentry in Ubuntu with Explanation

#### What is Sentry?
Sentry is an open-source platform designed to track errors, performance issues, and other exceptions in applications. It provides real-time event monitoring and alerting, making it easier for developers to identify and resolve issues quickly. Sentry supports various programming languages and frameworks like Python, JavaScript, and Node.js, offering rich insights into how errors occur in production. By integrating Sentry into your project, you can track bugs, exceptions, and performance bottlenecks, ensuring a smoother experience for end users while maintaining a more stable software application.

### Steps to Set Up, Run, and Use Sentry in Ubuntu

#### 1. **Install Dependencies**
Make sure you have `Docker` and `Docker Compose` installed, as Sentry runs using Docker.

- **Install Docker**:
      
    sudo apt install -y docker.io

- **Install Docker Compose**:
      
    sudo apt install -y docker-compose

- **Verify Docker installation**:
      
    docker --version

- **Verify Docker Compose installation**:
      
    docker-compose --version

#### 2. **Clone the Sentry Self-Hosted Repository**
Download the official Sentry self-hosted repository, which contains the configuration and setup files to run Sentry locally.

  
git clone https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted.git sentry-self-hosted
cd sentry-self-hosted

#### 3. **Configure Sentry**
Run the install script provided by Sentry, which will download necessary Docker images, set up the environment, and configure the application.

  
./install.sh

This step sets up the default configurations for running Sentry.

#### 4. **Modify Configuration Files (Optional)**
You can customize settings in the `.env` file, such as database credentials, ports, and other settings, if needed for your environment.

#### 5. **Run Sentry**
Once Sentry is configured, start it using Docker Compose. This will launch all Sentry-related services such as Postgres, Redis, and the Sentry application.

  
docker-compose up -d

Sentry will now be running in the background.

#### 6. **Access Sentry**
To access Sentry, open your browser and navigate to:

  
http://localhost:9000

Follow the on-screen instructions to set up an admin account and access the dashboard.

#### 7. **Verify Sentry is Running**
Check the status of the Docker containers to ensure all services are running properly.

  
docker-compose ps

You should see all necessary services like `web`, `postgres`, and `redis` listed as running.

#### 8. **Sending Test Events to Sentry**
To test that Sentry is working, integrate the Sentry SDK into one of your applications. For example, in a Python project:

- Install the Sentry SDK:
      
    pip install --upgrade sentry-sdk

- Initialize Sentry in your Python code:
      
    import sentry_sdk
    sentry_sdk.init("http://your-dsn-url")

- Trigger a test error:
      
    division_by_zero = 1 / 0

This error will be captured and displayed on your Sentry dashboard.

#### 9. **Stopping Sentry**
To stop the Sentry service and all related containers, run the following command:

  
docker-compose down

#### 10. **Restarting Sentry**
To bring Sentry back online, use the following command:

  
docker-compose up -d

This will restart all services in the background.

#### 11. **Updating Sentry**
If a new version of Sentry is released, you can update it by pulling the latest repository changes and re-running the install script:

  
git pull
./install.sh
docker-compose up -d

#### 12. **Cleaning Up**
To completely remove Sentry and its data from your system, run this command to stop and remove the Docker volumes:

  
docker-compose down --volumes

This will delete all data stored in the Sentry containers.
