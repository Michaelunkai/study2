# Comprehensive Guide to Mitigating Slowloris DoS Vulnerability on Ubuntu Servers Without Closing Ports

## 1. Introduction
This guide provides step-by-step instructions to mitigate the Slowloris DoS vulnerability on Ubuntu servers without closing ports. It covers configurations for both Apache and Nginx servers and includes general methods using tools like ModSecurity and Fail2ban.

## 2. Mitigating Slowloris DoS on Apache Server

### 2.1 Install `mod_reqtimeout` to Protect Apache from Slowloris Attacks
To begin, install the `mod_reqtimeout` module, which limits the time waiting on the client to prevent denial of service attacks.

sudo a2enmod reqtimeout

### 2.2 Configure `mod_reqtimeout` with Sensible Timeout Values
Next, create or edit the configuration file for `mod_reqtimeout` to set appropriate timeouts.

sudo nano /etc/apache2/mods-available/reqtimeout.conf

Add the following content:

 apache
<IfModule reqtimeout_module>
    # mod_reqtimeout limits the time waiting on the client to prevent an
    # attacker from causing a denial of service by opening many connections
    # but not sending requests. This file tries to give a sensible default
    # configuration, but it may be necessary to tune the timeout values to
    # the actual situation. Note that it is also possible to configure
    # mod_reqtimeout per virtual host.

    # Wait max 20 seconds for the first byte of the request line+headers
    # From then, require a minimum data rate of 500 bytes/s, but don't
    # wait longer than 40 seconds in total.
    # Note: Lower timeouts may make sense on non-ssl virtual hosts but can
    # cause problem with ssl enabled virtual hosts: This timeout includes
    # the time a browser may need to fetch the CRL for the certificate. If
    # the CRL server is not reachable, it may take more than 10 seconds
    # until the browser gives up.
    RequestReadTimeout header=20-40,minrate=500

    # Wait max 10 seconds for the first byte of the request body (if any)
    # From then, require a minimum data rate of 500 bytes/s
    RequestReadTimeout body=10,minrate=500
</IfModule>

# vim: syntax=apache ts=4 sw=4 sts=4 sr noet

### 2.3 Restart Apache to Apply the New Configuration
Finally, restart the Apache server to apply the new configuration.

sudo systemctl restart apache2

## 3. Mitigating Slowloris DoS on Nginx Server

### 3.1 Install Required Modules to Limit Connections and Request Rates
Install `ngx_http_limit_conn_module` and `ngx_http_limit_req_module` to limit the number of connections and request rates.

### 3.2 Configure Connection Limits and Request Rates in Nginx
Edit the Nginx configuration file to set up connection limits and request rates.

sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

Add the following lines in the `http` section:

 nginx
http {
    # Limit the number of simultaneous connections to a single IP
    limit_conn_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=conn_limit:10m;
    limit_conn conn_limit 10;

    # Limit the request rate to a single IP
    limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=req_limit:10m rate=1r/s;
    
    server {
        location / {
            limit_conn conn_limit 10;
            limit_req zone=req_limit burst=5 nodelay;
        }
    }
}

### 3.3 Restart Nginx to Apply the New Configuration
Restart the Nginx server to apply the new configuration.

sudo systemctl restart nginx

## 4. General Methods to Mitigate Slowloris DoS Attacks

### 4.1 Install and Configure a Web Application Firewall (WAF) with ModSecurity
A Web Application Firewall like ModSecurity can protect against various types of attacks, including Slowloris.

sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-security2

Enable and configure ModSecurity as per your requirements.

### 4.2 Install and Configure Fail2ban to Automatically Ban Malicious IPs
Fail2ban helps in banning IPs that show malicious signs.

sudo apt-get install fail2ban

#### 4.2.1 Create a New Jail for HTTP Servers
Create a new jail configuration for HTTP servers.

sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local

Add the following configuration:

 ini
[http-get-dos]
enabled = true
filter = http-get-dos
logpath = /var/log/apache2/access.log
maxretry = 300
findtime = 300
bantime = 600
action = iptables[name=HTTP, port=http, protocol=tcp]

#### 4.2.2 Create the Filter File for HTTP GET DoS
Create the filter file that Fail2ban will use to detect malicious activity.

sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/http-get-dos.conf

Add the following content:

 ini
[Definition]
failregex = ^<HOST> -.*"(GET|POST).*

#### 4.2.3 Restart Fail2ban to Apply the New Configuration
Restart the Fail2ban service to apply the new configuration.

sudo systemctl restart fail2ban

### 4.3 Adjust Kernel Parameters to Mitigate Slowloris Attacks
Modify kernel parameters to further protect your server from Slowloris attacks.

sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf

Add the following lines:

 ini
net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1
net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog = 2048
net.ipv4.tcp_synack_retries = 2
net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout = 30

Apply the changes:

sudo sysctl -p

## 5. Conclusion
By following these steps, you can significantly reduce the risk of a Slowloris DoS attack on your Ubuntu server without closing any ports. Implementing these configurations and tools will help enhance the security and stability of your server.
