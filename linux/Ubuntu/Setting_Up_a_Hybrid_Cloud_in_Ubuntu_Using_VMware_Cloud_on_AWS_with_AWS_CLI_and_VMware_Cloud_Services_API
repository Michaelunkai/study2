### **Comprehensive Guide: Setting Up a Hybrid Cloud in Ubuntu Using VMware Cloud on AWS with AWS CLI and VMware Cloud Services API**

---

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a hybrid cloud in Ubuntu using VMware Cloud on AWS with AWS CLI and the VMware Cloud Services API. You'll learn how to install necessary tools, configure AWS CLI, create a VMware Cloud on AWS SDDC, and deploy workloads. This tutorial covers everything from start to finish, including optional setup for AWS Direct Connect.

---

### **Step 1: Install Required Tools on Ubuntu**

First, you need to install the necessary tools on your Ubuntu machine:

  
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y awscli jq unzip open-vm-tools open-vm-tools-desktop

This command installs AWS CLI, `jq` for processing JSON data, `unzip` for extracting files, and VMware tools.

---

### **Step 2: Configure AWS CLI**

Next, configure the AWS CLI with your credentials:

  
aws configure

When prompted, enter the following:
- AWS Access Key ID
- AWS Secret Access Key
- Default region name
- Default output format (e.g., json)

This configuration allows you to interact with AWS services from the command line.

---

### **Step 3: Set Up VMware Cloud on AWS**

VMware Cloud on AWS requires specific APIs to interact with. You'll need to use the VMware Cloud Services API. First, install the `vmc-cli` tool using Pythonâ€™s package manager:

  
pip install vmc-cli

This command installs the VMware Cloud Services CLI tool (`vmc-cli`), which allows you to manage VMware Cloud on AWS.

---

### **Step 4: Authenticate with VMware Cloud on AWS**

Authenticate with VMware Cloud on AWS using your VMware Cloud credentials:

  
vmc login --refresh-token <YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN>

Replace `<YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN>` with your actual VMware Cloud refresh token. This step is necessary for accessing VMware Cloud services.

---

### **Step 5: Create a VMware Cloud on AWS SDDC**

Create a new Software-Defined Data Center (SDDC) in VMware Cloud on AWS:

  
vmc orgs sddcs create --org-id <YOUR_ORG_ID> --region <AWS_REGION> --provider "AWS" --name <SDDC_NAME> --vpc <AWS_VPC_ID> --num-hosts 1

Replace the following placeholders:
- `<YOUR_ORG_ID>`: Your VMware organization ID.
- `<AWS_REGION>`: The AWS region where the SDDC will be deployed.
- `<SDDC_NAME>`: The desired name for your SDDC.
- `<AWS_VPC_ID>`: The ID of the AWS VPC where the SDDC will be connected.

This command sets up the SDDC, which serves as the backbone of your hybrid cloud environment.

---

### **Step 6: Configure Networking Between On-Premises and VMware Cloud on AWS**

Set up hybrid connectivity between your on-premises VMware environment and VMware Cloud on AWS:

  
vmc networking create-vpn --sddc-id <SDDC_ID> --org-id <YOUR_ORG_ID> --name <VPN_NAME> --peer-ip <PEER_IP> --local-id <LOCAL_ID>

Replace the following placeholders:
- `<SDDC_ID>`: The ID of the SDDC you created.
- `<YOUR_ORG_ID>`: Your VMware organization ID.
- `<VPN_NAME>`: The name for your VPN.
- `<PEER_IP>`: The IP address of the on-premises VPN endpoint.
- `<LOCAL_ID>`: The local ID for your VPN setup.

This command establishes secure communication between your on-premises infrastructure and VMware Cloud on AWS.

---

### **Step 7: Optional - Set Up AWS Direct Connect**

For high-performance networking, you can set up AWS Direct Connect:

  
aws directconnect create-connection --location <AWS_DC_LOCATION> --bandwidth <BANDWIDTH> --connection-name <CONNECTION_NAME>

Replace the following placeholders:
- `<AWS_DC_LOCATION>`: The AWS Direct Connect location.
- `<BANDWIDTH>`: The bandwidth for the connection (e.g., 1Gbps).
- `<CONNECTION_NAME>`: A name for your Direct Connect connection.

This step is optional but recommended for low-latency, high-bandwidth connections.

---

### **Step 8: Deploy Workloads on Your Hybrid Cloud**

Deploy workloads on your hybrid cloud environment:

  
aws ec2 run-instances --image-id <AMI_ID> --count 1 --instance-type <INSTANCE_TYPE> --key-name <KEY_NAME> --security-group-ids <SECURITY_GROUP_ID> --subnet-id <SUBNET_ID>

Replace the following placeholders:
- `<AMI_ID>`: The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID for the instance.
- `<INSTANCE_TYPE>`: The type of instance (e.g., t2.micro).
- `<KEY_NAME>`: The name of your SSH key pair.
- `<SECURITY_GROUP_ID>`: The security group ID.
- `<SUBNET_ID>`: The subnet ID.

This command launches an EC2 instance in your hybrid cloud.

---

### **Step 9: Monitor and Manage Your Hybrid Cloud**

Use VMware Cloud and AWS management tools to monitor and manage your hybrid cloud environment. You can leverage AWS CloudWatch, VMware vRealize Operations, and other tools for this purpose.

---

### **Step 10: Tear Down Resources When No Longer Needed**

When you no longer need the setup, tear down the resources:

  
aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids <INSTANCE_ID>
vmc orgs sddcs delete --org-id <YOUR_ORG_ID> --sddc-id <SDDC_ID>

Replace `<INSTANCE_ID>`, `<YOUR_ORG_ID>`, and `<SDDC_ID>` with your specific values. This ensures that you stop incurring costs for unused resources.

---

By following these steps, you will successfully set up a hybrid cloud environment in Ubuntu using VMware Cloud on AWS with AWS CLI and VMware Cloud Services API. This setup provides the flexibility and scalability needed to extend your on-premises infrastructure to the cloud, leveraging the benefits of both environments.
