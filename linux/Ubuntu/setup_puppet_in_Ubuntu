Step 1: Remove Any Existing Puppet Installation
Remove the Puppet package if it exists:

 
 
sudo apt remove --purge puppet-agent
Clean up any remaining files:

 
 
sudo rm -rf /etc/puppetlabs
sudo rm -rf /opt/puppetlabs
Step 2: Install Puppet
Update the package list:

 
 
sudo apt update
Download and install the Puppet repository:

 
 
wget https://apt.puppet.com/puppet7-release-bullseye.deb
sudo dpkg -i puppet7-release-bullseye.deb
Update the package list again to include the Puppet repository:

 
 
sudo apt update
Install Puppet Agent:

 
 
sudo apt install puppet-agent
Step 3: Verify Installation
Check the installation directories:

 
 
ls /opt/puppetlabs/bin
ls /etc/puppetlabs/puppet
Check Puppet agent version to ensure it's installed correctly:

 
 
/opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet --version
Step 4: Configure Puppet Agent
Edit the Puppet configuration file:

 
 
sudo nano /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf
Add the following configuration under the [main] section (replace puppetmaster.example.com with your Puppet serverâ€™s hostname):

ini
 
[main]
server = puppetmaster.example.com
Save and exit the file.

Step 5: Start and Enable Puppet Agent
Start the Puppet service:

 
 
sudo systemctl start puppet
Enable Puppet to start on boot:

 
 
sudo systemctl enable puppet
Step 6: Run Puppet Agent
Run Puppet agent to test the connection to the Puppet server:
 
 
sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet agent --test
Step 7: Install Puppet Server (if you don't have one)
Install Puppet Server:

 
 
sudo apt install puppetserver
Start and enable the Puppet Server:

 
 
sudo systemctl start puppetserver
sudo systemctl enable puppetserver
Edit the Puppet Server configuration file to allocate more memory (optional but recommended):

 
 
sudo nano /etc/default/puppetserver
Increase the JAVA_ARGS to allocate more memory:

ini
 
JAVA_ARGS="-Xms512m -Xmx512m"
Step 8: Sign the Certificate (on Puppet Server)
List unsigned certificates:

 
 
sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppetserver ca list
Sign the certificate for your agent (replace hostname with the actual hostname of your agent):

 
 
sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppetserver ca sign --certname hostname
Step 9: Create a Puppet Manifest
Create a directory for your Puppet manifests:

 
 
sudo mkdir -p /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests
Create a simple manifest file:

 
 
sudo nano /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/site.pp
Add the following content to manage a file resource:

puppet
 
node default {
  file { '/tmp/hello.txt':
    ensure  => 'present',
    content => 'Hello, Puppet!',
  }
}
Save and exit the file.

Step 10: Apply the Manifest
Run Puppet agent on the agent node to apply the manifest:

 
 
sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet agent --test
Check if the file has been created:

 
 
cat /tmp/hello.txt
You should see the content Hello, Puppet!.

Step 11: Automate Puppet Agent Runs
Enable the Puppet agent to run periodically (default every 30 minutes):
 
 
sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet resource service puppet ensure=running enable=true
With these steps, you should have a basic Puppet setup on Kali Linux, with an agent communicating with the server and applying manifests to manage resources. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
