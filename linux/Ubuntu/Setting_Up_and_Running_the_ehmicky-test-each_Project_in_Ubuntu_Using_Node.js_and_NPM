### **Comprehensive Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up and Running the "ehmicky/test-each" Project in Ubuntu Using Node.js and NPM**

---

#### **Step 1: Clone the "ehmicky/test-each" GitHub Repository**

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine using the `git` command.

  
git clone https://github.com/ehmicky/test-each.git
cd test-each

#### **Step 2: Install Node.js and NPM on Ubuntu**

Ensure you have Node.js and NPM installed on your Ubuntu system. If they are not installed, you can do so with the following command:

  
sudo apt install -y nodejs npm

This will install Node.js and its package manager, NPM, which are required to run the project.

#### **Step 3: Install Project Dependencies Using NPM**

Navigate to the cloned project directory and install all the necessary dependencies defined in the `package.json` file:

  
npm install

This command installs all the required Node.js modules and dependencies needed to run the project.

#### **Step 4: Run the Tests Using a Test Runner (e.g., Ava)**

To run the tests provided in the repository, you will need a test runner. If you choose to use Ava (as demonstrated in the example), install it globally using NPM:

  
npm install -g ava

After installing Ava, you can run the tests with the following command:

  
npm test

This command executes the tests as defined in the project, ensuring everything is working correctly.

#### **Step 5: Create and Run Example Tests Provided in the Repository**

If you want to run the example tests mentioned in the `README.md`, create a new JavaScript file in the project directory, and include the example code. Then, run it using Ava:

  
nano example_test.js

Copy and paste the example code into `example_test.js`, save the file, and run it:

  
ava example_test.js

This allows you to see how the `test-each` library functions with different test scenarios.

#### **Step 6: Explore Additional Features of the "test-each" Library**

The `test-each` library offers a variety of features such as snapshot testing, fuzz testing, and cartesian product of test cases. You can explore these features by modifying the example tests or writing your own test cases.

Refer to the `README.md` file in the repository for more detailed usage instructions and examples.

#### **Step 7: Clean Up After Running the Tests**

If you want to clean up your environment after testing, you can remove the installed global dependencies (like Ava) with:

  
npm uninstall -g ava

This step ensures that your environment is clean and free from unnecessary global packages after you've finished running the tests.

This comprehensive guide covers everything from cloning the repository to running the tests using Node.js, NPM, and Ava in an Ubuntu environment. By following these steps, you can set up and run the "ehmicky/test-each" project efficiently.
