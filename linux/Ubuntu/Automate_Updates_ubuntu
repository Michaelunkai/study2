To automate the process of checking for and installing updates, you can use unattended-upgrades. Install and configure it with the following commands:

Install Unattended Upgrades:

 
 
sudo apt install unattended-upgrades -y
Enable Unattended Upgrades:

 
 
sudo dpkg-reconfigure --priority=low unattended-upgrades
Configure Unattended Upgrades:

Edit the configuration file to fine-tune the settings if necessary:

 
 
sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades
In this file, you can specify which updates to automatically install, email notifications, and more.

Enable Periodic Updates:

Edit the configuration file to enable periodic updates:

 
 
sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades
Add or modify the lines to look like this:

plaintext
 
APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists "1";
APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade "1";
Step 7: Check Update Logs
To ensure everything is working correctly, check the update logs periodically:

 
 
cat /var/log/unattended-upgrades/unattended-upgrades.log
Step 8: Apply Security Patches Only (Optional)
If you only want to apply security patches and not other updates, you can configure unattended-upgrades to do so:

Edit Unattended Upgrades Configuration:

 
 
sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades
Uncomment or add the security updates line:

plaintext
 
"${distro_id}:${distro_codename}-security";
