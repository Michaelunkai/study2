Here's a step-by-step guide to set up eSpeak in Ubuntu and use it to convert text files to audio:

### 1. Install eSpeak
First, open your terminal and install eSpeak using the following command:

  
sudo apt update && sudo apt install espeak -y

### 2. Convert Text to Speech
Once eSpeak is installed, you can use it to convert text to speech. For example, to convert a text string:

  
espeak "Hello, welcome to eSpeak!"

### 3. Convert a Text File to Speech
If you have a text file that you want to convert to speech, use the following command:

  
espeak -f /path/to/your/textfile.txt

Replace `/path/to/your/textfile.txt` with the actual path to your text file.

### 4. Save Speech to Audio File
To save the spoken text as an audio file, you can use this command:

  
espeak -f /path/to/your/textfile.txt -w output.wav

This will save the audio as a `wav` file named `output.wav`.

### 5. Play the Audio File
You can play the audio file using any media player, or directly from the terminal using `aplay`:

  
aplay output.wav

This setup allows you to use eSpeak for converting text files to audio on Ubuntu.
