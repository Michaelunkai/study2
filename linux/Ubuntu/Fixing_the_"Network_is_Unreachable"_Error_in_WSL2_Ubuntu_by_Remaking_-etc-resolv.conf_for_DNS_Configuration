### Full Step-by-Step Troubleshooting Guide: Fixing the "Network is Unreachable" Error in WSL2 Ubuntu by Remaking `/etc/resolv.conf` for DNS Configuration

When encountering the error `Cannot initiate the connection to archive.ubuntu.com:80... Network is unreachable` in WSL2 Ubuntu, this comprehensive troubleshooting guide will help you fix the issue by remaking the `/etc/resolv.conf` file for DNS configuration. Follow the steps below to resolve network-related problems in WSL2:

---

#### **Step 1: Disable Automatic Generation of `resolv.conf` in WSL2**

First, you need to stop WSL2 from automatically overwriting the `/etc/resolv.conf` file.

1. Open a terminal in WSL2 and run the following command to create or edit the WSL configuration file:

      
    sudo nano /etc/wsl.conf

2. Add the following lines to prevent automatic generation of the `resolv.conf` file:

     ini
    [network]
    generateResolvConf = false

3. Save the file by pressing `CTRL + O`, then press `Enter`, and finally exit by pressing `CTRL + X`.

---

#### **Step 2: Remove the Existing `resolv.conf` File**

Now that automatic generation is disabled, remove the current `resolv.conf` file.

1. Run the following command to delete the file:

      
    sudo rm /etc/resolv.conf

---

#### **Step 3: Create a New `resolv.conf` File with Reliable DNS Servers**

You will now manually create a new `resolv.conf` file and add reliable DNS server information (Google and Cloudflare DNS).

1. Run the following command to create and open a new `resolv.conf` file:

      
    sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf

2. Add the following lines to use Google's and Cloudflare's DNS servers:

      
    nameserver 8.8.8.8
    nameserver 8.8.4.4
    nameserver 1.1.1.1

3. Save the file by pressing `CTRL + O`, then press `Enter`, and exit by pressing `CTRL + X`.

---

#### **Step 4: Restart WSL2 to Apply Changes**

To apply the new DNS configuration, you need to restart WSL2.

1. Close your WSL2 terminal and open PowerShell or Command Prompt.
2. Run the following command to shut down all running WSL2 instances:

      
    wsl --shutdown

3. Once WSL2 is stopped, reopen your WSL2 terminal, and the new DNS configuration should be applied.

---

### **Final Step: Verify Network Connectivity**

After restarting WSL2, verify that your internet connection works correctly by pinging an external address:

  
ping -c 4 google.com

If you receive replies, your network is now correctly configured, and the `Network is unreachable` error should be resolved.

By following this troubleshooting guide, the DNS settings in WSL2 Ubuntu should now be correctly configured, resolving the `Network is unreachable` error.
