Sure, here's a step-by-step guide to setting up a portable web server using `lighttpd` on Ubuntu:

### Step 1: Update System Packages
First, make sure your package list is up to date:
```sh
sudo apt update
```

### Step 2: Install lighttpd
Install `lighttpd` using the following command:
```sh
sudo apt install lighttpd -y
```

### Step 3: Start and Enable lighttpd
Start the `lighttpd` service and enable it to start on boot:
```sh
sudo systemctl start lighttpd
sudo systemctl enable lighttpd
```

### Step 4: Verify Installation
To check if `lighttpd` is running, open a web browser and enter your serverâ€™s IP address. You should see the default `lighttpd` welcome page.

You can find your server's IP address with:
```sh
hostname -I
```

### Step 5: Configure lighttpd
The main configuration file for `lighttpd` is located at `/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf`. You can edit this file to suit your needs.

For example, to change the document root:
```sh
sudo nano /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf
```

Look for the following line:
```sh
server.document-root        = "/var/www/html"
```
You can change the directory path to your desired document root.

### Step 6: Set Up Permissions
Ensure the document root directory has the correct permissions. For example, if the document root is `/var/www/html`:
```sh
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html
```

### Step 7: Add Your Website
Place your website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) into the document root directory. By default, this is `/var/www/html`.

### Step 8: Configure Firewall
If you have a firewall enabled, allow traffic on HTTP (port 80):
```sh
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
```

### Step 9: Restart lighttpd
After making any changes to the configuration, restart `lighttpd` to apply them:
```sh
sudo systemctl restart lighttpd
```

### Step 10: Verify Your Website
Open a web browser and enter your server's IP address. You should see your website.

### Step 11: Additional Configurations
You can enable additional modules in `lighttpd` by editing the configuration file or creating a custom configuration file in `/etc/lighttpd/conf-enabled/`.

For example, to enable URL rewriting, you can add:
```sh
server.modules += ( "mod_rewrite" )
```

### Step 12: Make lighttpd Portable
To make `lighttpd` portable, you can use a USB drive or any portable storage to hold your `lighttpd` installation and configuration. Copy the `lighttpd` configuration, document root, and binary files to the portable storage.

1. Create a directory on your portable storage:
   ```sh
   mkdir /media/usb/lighttpd
   ```

2. Copy `lighttpd` configuration and document root:
   ```sh
   sudo cp -r /etc/lighttpd /media/usb/lighttpd/config
   sudo cp -r /var/www/html /media/usb/lighttpd/www
   ```

3. Modify the `lighttpd` configuration to use relative paths or paths on the portable storage.

### Step 13: Start lighttpd from Portable Storage
To start `lighttpd` using your portable storage:
1. Mount the portable storage if not already mounted:
   ```sh
   sudo mount /dev/sdX1 /media/usb
   ```

2. Start `lighttpd` with the custom configuration:
   ```sh
   sudo lighttpd -f /media/usb/lighttpd/config/lighttpd.conf
   ```

Your `lighttpd` server should now be running using the configuration and document root from your portable storage.

That's it! You now have a portable `lighttpd` web server running on Ubuntu.
