OpenVAS (Open Vulnerability Assessment System) is an open-source tool for vulnerability scanning and management. Itâ€™s highly versatile and can be used to identify security issues in various systems and applications. Here's a guide on how to gather information using OpenVAS on Ubuntu.

### Step 1: Install OpenVAS

1. **Update your system:**
     
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade

2. **Add the PPA repository:**
     
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mrazavi/openvas
   sudo apt update

3. **Install OpenVAS:**
     
   sudo apt install openvas

4. **Run the setup script to configure OpenVAS:**
     
   sudo gvm-setup

   This process can take some time as it downloads and configures necessary components.

5. **Start the OpenVAS services:**
     
   sudo gvm-start

### Step 2: Access OpenVAS Web Interface

1. **Retrieve the admin password:**
     
   sudo cat /var/lib/gvm/.config/gvm-password

2. **Open a web browser and go to:**
   https://localhost:9392

3. **Log in using the username `admin` and the password retrieved in the previous step.**

### Step 3: Configuring and Running a Scan

1. **Create a new scan target:**
   - Go to the "Configuration" tab.
   - Click on "Targets".
   - Click on the green star icon to create a new target.
   - Fill in the details such as the name and the IP address or domain of the target.
   - Save the target.

2. **Create a new task:**
   - Go to the "Scans" tab.
   - Click on "Tasks".
   - Click on the green star icon to create a new task.
   - Fill in the task details such as the name and select the previously created target.
   - Save the task.

3. **Start the scan:**
   - Go to the "Scans" tab.
   - Click on "Tasks".
   - Find the task you created and click on the blue play button to start the scan.

### Step 4: Analyzing Scan Results

1. **View the scan results:**
   - Go to the "Scans" tab.
   - Click on "Reports".
   - Click on the report corresponding to your scan task.

2. **Analyze the findings:**
   - The report will show vulnerabilities found, their severity, and recommended actions.
   - Click on individual vulnerabilities for more detailed information.

### Step 5: Regular Maintenance

1. **Update the vulnerability database regularly:**
     
   sudo greenbone-nvt-sync

2. **Restart the OpenVAS services after updates:**
     
   sudo gvm-stop
   sudo gvm-start
