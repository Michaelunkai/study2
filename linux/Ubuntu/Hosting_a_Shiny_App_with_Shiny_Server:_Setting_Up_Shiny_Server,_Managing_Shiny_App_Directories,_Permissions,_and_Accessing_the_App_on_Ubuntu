To host your project using **Shiny Server** after setting it up with your provided command, follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Guide for Hosting a Shiny Project on Shiny Server

1. **Verify Shiny Server is Running**
   After installation, check if the Shiny Server is running:

     
   sudo systemctl status shiny-server

   If it's not running, you can start it with:

     
   sudo systemctl start shiny-server

2. **Create Your Shiny Project Directory**
   Shiny Server expects the Shiny apps to be located in `/srv/shiny-server`. You can create a directory for your app:

     
   sudo mkdir /srv/shiny-server/myapp

3. **Place Your Shiny App in the Directory**
   You need to have at least two files in the app directory: `ui.R` and `server.R`. You can copy your existing Shiny app files to `/srv/shiny-server/myapp/`:

     
   sudo cp /path/to/your/app/* /srv/shiny-server/myapp/

4. **Set the Correct Permissions**
   Ensure that Shiny Server has the proper permissions to run your app:

     
   sudo chown -R shiny /srv/shiny-server/myapp/
   sudo chmod -R 755 /srv/shiny-server/myapp/

5. **Access Your App**
   By default, Shiny Server runs on port 3838. You can access your Shiny app at:

   http://<your-server-ip>:3838/myapp

   Replace `<your-server-ip>` with your actual server's IP address or domain.

6. **Manage Shiny Server**
   You can manage Shiny Server using the following commands:
   
   - **Restart Shiny Server:**
       
     sudo systemctl restart shiny-server

   - **Stop Shiny Server:**
       
     sudo systemctl stop shiny-server

   - **Enable Shiny Server to start on boot:**
       
     sudo systemctl enable shiny-server

This will get your Shiny app hosted on your server with Shiny Server after setting it up with the provided command.
