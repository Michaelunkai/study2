To set up and use Annyang, a JavaScript library for adding voice commands to your web applications, on Ubuntu, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install Node.js and npm
First, you need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. Open a terminal and run:

  
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs npm

Verify the installation:

  
node -v
npm -v

### Step 2: Set Up Your Project
Create a directory for your project and navigate into it:

  
mkdir annyang-demo
cd annyang-demo

Initialize a new Node.js project:

  
npm init -y

### Step 3: Install Annyang
Annyang is a client-side library, so you don't need to install it via npm. Instead, you can include it directly in your HTML file. However, if you want to manage your dependencies more efficiently, you can use npm to install annyang.

  
npm install annyang

### Step 4: Create Your HTML File
Create an `index.html` file in your project directory and include Annyang:

 html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Annyang Demo</title>
    <script src="node_modules/annyang/annyang.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Annyang Demo</h1>
    <p>Speak "Hello" to see the magic happen!</p>
    <script>
        if (annyang) {
            // Define your commands.
            var commands = {
                'hello': function() { alert('Hello! How can I help you?'); }
            };

            // Add the commands to annyang.
            annyang.addCommands(commands);

            // Start listening.
            annyang.start();
        } else {
            alert('Annyang is not supported in your browser.');
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>

### Step 5: Serve Your Project
To run your project, you can use a simple HTTP server. Install the `http-server` package globally:

  
npm install -g http-server

Start the server in your project directory:

  
http-server

By default, `http-server` will serve your files at `http://localhost:8080`. Open this URL in your web browser to test the Annyang integration.

### Trouble ooting
1. **Microphone Permissions:** Ensure that your web browser has permission to use the microphone.
2. **Browser Compatibility:** Annyang works best in Chrome. Make sure you are using a compatible browser.
3. **HTTPS Requirement:** Speech recognition requires a secure context (HTTPS). If you're running this locally, you might need to configure your server for HTTPS.

### Summary
You have set up Annyang in a simple HTML project on Ubuntu. You can now expand the `commands` object to include more voice commands and functionalities as needed.
