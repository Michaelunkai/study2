Introduction to Hermes 3: A New Era for Llama Fine-Tuning
Nous Research, in collaboration with Lambda, introduces Hermes 3—the first full-parameter fine-tune of Meta's Llama 3.1 405B model. Hermes 3, designed with the open-source community in mind, offers enhanced reasoning capabilities and is available for free through the new Lambda Chat Completions API and Lambda Chat interface.
Training and Optimization on Lambda's 1-Click Cluster
Hermes 3 was developed using an 8-node Lambda 1-Click Cluster, achieving remarkable results within weeks. This model surpasses Llama 3.1 Instruct in open-source LLM benchmarks, offering a flexible and powerful tool for complex tasks.
Key Features and Capabilities of Hermes 3
- Unlocked and Steerable: Hermes 3 is uncensored and highly adaptable, making it ideal for role-playing, creative writing, and professional decision-making tasks.
- Optimized for Efficiency: Trained with synthesized data, RLHF, and quantized using Neural Magic’s FP8 method, Hermes 3 operates with significantly reduced VRAM and disk requirements, making it scalable from a single node to a multi-node cluster.
- User-Centric Design: Hermes 3 aligns with the user rather than corporate interests, marking a significant advancement in open-source AI.
Availability and Free Access
Lambda offers free access to Hermes 3 through the Lambda Chat Completions API, compatible with OpenAI's API. Users can quickly generate a Cloud API key and begin exploring the model with no complex setup required.
Conclusion
Hermes 3 sets a new standard in fine-tuning large language models, providing unparalleled flexibility and performance for both creative and professional applications. Try Hermes 3 for free and experience the future of open-source AI.
