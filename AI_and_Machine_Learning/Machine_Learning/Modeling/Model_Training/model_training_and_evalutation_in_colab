Model Training and Evaluation
Splitting Data:
 
 
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
Training a Model (Example with Scikit-learn):
 
 
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
Making Predictions:
 
 
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
Eva ting the Model:
 
 
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
