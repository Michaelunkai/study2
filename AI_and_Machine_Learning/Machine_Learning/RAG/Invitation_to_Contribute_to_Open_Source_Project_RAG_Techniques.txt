**Invitation to Contribute to Open Source Project: RAG Techniques**
In just two weeks, the repo for the collection of RAG technique guides has gained over 2K stars on GitHub, and the number of inquiries I’m receiving is increasing. More and more people are discovering, benefiting from, and spreading the word about this project.
This is an open-source project that brings together a wide variety of methods to improve and challenge RAG solutions, enabling optimal interaction with your data.
The project includes:
- A verbal description for each method, including motivation, key tools, and a detailed explanation of the technique and its advantages.
- A graphical visualization of the algorithm.
- A detailed implementation of the method in a Python notebook, following the chronological order of building the solution.
- A demonstration of using the method.
- Comparisons of the method against a baseline.
Due to high demand and interest, I’m making this a collaborative project, and the wider community is invited to contribute to the code and receive credit as contributors.
There are many ways to contribute:
- Adding new or additional methods.
- Qualitative and quantitative comparisons between the methods.
- Alternative implementations.
- Logical improvements or optimizations of existing implementations.
- Testing on different use cases.
Additionally, a Discord community has been created where you can discuss code contributions, seek advice, and ask questions about the topic in general.
Detailed instructions on how to contribute and a link to join the Discord community can be found at the top of the repo.
