Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) is a neural retrieval technique commonly used in natural language processing, particularly in question-answering tasks. DPR involves two neural networks (often BERT-based): one for encoding questions and another for encoding passages (or documents). The key idea is to convert both the question and passages into dense vectors in a shared embedding space, where semantically similar question-passage pairs are close to each other.

### Key Components:
1. **Question Encoder**: Converts the input question into a dense vector.
2. **Passage Encoder**: Converts passages into dense vectors.
3. **Similarity Matching**: Uses dot-product or cosine similarity to match the question vector with the most relevant passage vectors.

### Usage:
- **Open-domain Question Answering**: DPR is commonly used to retrieve relevant documents from a large corpus that are likely to contain answers to a given question.
- **Information Retrieval**: It's applied in systems requiring fast and accurate document retrieval based on a query, leveraging dense vector representations instead of traditional term-based methods.

DPR is effective in scenarios where exact term matching is insufficient, and semantic understanding is crucial.
