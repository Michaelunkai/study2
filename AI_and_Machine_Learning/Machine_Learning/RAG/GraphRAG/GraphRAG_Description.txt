GraphRAG (Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an advanced technique developed by Microsoft to enhance traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Unlike naive RAG methods that rely on vector similarity searches using plain text snippets, GraphRAG constructs a knowledge graph from unstructured text. This graph captures entities, relationships, and key claims, organizing them into a hierarchical community structure.
GraphRAG provides several key advantages:
1. Structured Knowledge Retrieval: By extracting and structuring data into a knowledge graph, GraphRAG can more effectively retrieve relevant information and provide comprehensive answers.
2. Community Summaries: It generates summaries for various community clusters within the knowledge graph, which helps answer broader, holistic questions about the dataset.
3. Enhanced Query Performance: GraphRAG's approach allows for better performance in answering complex, multi-hop questions that require connecting disparate pieces of information. This is particularly useful for private or proprietary datasets where baseline RAG methods fall short.
GraphRAG leverages LLMs (Large Language Models) to generate and utilize these knowledge graphs, thereby improving the comprehensiveness, diversity, and empowerment of the generated answers. It also supports provenance tracking, enabling users to verify the source and accuracy of the information provided by the system.
