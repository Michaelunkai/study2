 Write a Simple NLP Script
Create a Python script to test SpaCy. For example, create a file named spacy_test.py and add the following code:

 
 
import spacy

# Load the language model
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Process a text
doc = nlp("SpaCy is an amazing library for NLP tasks.")

# Print the tokens and their parts of speech
for token in doc:
    print(f"{token.text} - {token.pos_}")
Step 6: Run Your Script
Run the script to see SpaCy in action:

 
 
  spacy_test.py
You should see output similar to:

 
 
SpaCy - PROPN
is - AUX
an - DET
amazing - ADJ
library - NOUN
for - ADP
NLP - PROPN
tasks - NOUN
. - PUNCT
