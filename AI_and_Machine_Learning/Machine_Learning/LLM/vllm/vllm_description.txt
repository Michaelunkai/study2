VLLM is an advanced, high-performance library for efficient and scalable deployment of large language models (LLMs). Developed by researchers, VLLM focuses on optimizing inference of LLMs to improve speed and reduce computational resources. It aims to enable large-scale applications by providing a flexible and user-friendly interface, supporting both single-node and distributed setups. This allows users to deploy LLMs for various natural language processing tasks efficiently.
