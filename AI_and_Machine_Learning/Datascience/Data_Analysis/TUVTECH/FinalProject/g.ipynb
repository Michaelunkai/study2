    "\n",
    "Understanding the distribution of global sales can reveal whether most games achieve low sales, while a few hit very high sales. The following graphs show:\n",
    "- A histogram of Global Sales to view the frequency distribution.\n",
    "- A density plot to observe the smoothed distribution curve.\n",
    "- A box plot that highlights outliers and the median.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis:\n",
    "- **Histogram:** The histogram typically shows that most games have relatively low global sales, with a long tail indicating a small number of games achieving very high sales.\n",
    "- **Density Plot:** The density plot confirms the skewness in the distribution.\n",
    "- **Box Plot:** Outliers visible in the box plot suggest that there are exceptional games with very high sales, which might be worth further investigation."

    "### Question 1 - Distribution of Global Sales:\n",
    "- The histogram and density plot show that the majority of games have low sales, while a few games achieve very high global sales.\n",
    "- The box plot highlights outliers that indicate exceptional success in the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2 - Top Genre by Average Global Sales:\n",
    "- The analysis indicates that certain genres (for example, Action or Shooter) tend to have higher average sales.\n",
    "- This insight may help developers and investors identify profitable game genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3 - Sales by Platform:\n",
    "- The total sales table and bar chart reveal which platforms dominate in terms of sales volume.\n",
    "- The pie chart clearly shows the percentage contribution of each platform, illustrating market preferences.\n",
