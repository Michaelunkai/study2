This summary includes count, mean, standard deviation (std), minimum (min), 25th percentile, 50th percentile (median), 75th percentile, and maximum (max) for each numeric column.\n\n#### Insights:\n\n1. **Count**: All columns have 4801 non-null entries, indicating a consistent data set across all columns.\n\n2. **Mean**:\n   - The average (mean) price of properties is approximately 2.36 million, suggesting a dataset with potentially high-value properties.\n   - The average number of bedrooms is around 3.36, and bathrooms around 2.37, indicating that the properties are relatively spacious.\n   - The mean property square footage is approximately 2184.21 sqft, supporting the notion of relatively large properties in the dataset.\n\n3. **Standard Deviation (std)**:\n   - A very high standard deviation in price (over 31 million) suggests a wide range of property values, possibly including both very high and very low-priced properties.\n   - The standard deviations for beds, baths, and property square footage also indicate a significant variability in property sizes and types.\n\n4. **Minimum Values (min)**:\n   - The minimum values for price, beds, baths, and property square footage are quite low (e.g., properties with 0 baths and properties as small as 230 sqft), indicating the presence of very small or possibly underdeveloped properties in the dataset.\n\n5. **Percentiles (25%, 50%, 75%)**:\n   - The 25th, 50th (median), and 75th percentiles provide a sense of the distribution of values. For instance, 50% of the properties cost less than 825,000, which is significantly lower than the mean, suggesting a skewed distribution with some very high-priced properties.\n\n6. **Maximum Values (max)**:\n   - The maximum values, especially for price (over 2 billion) and property size (up to 50 beds and 50 baths), are exceptionally high, indicating the presence of some extremely large and/or expensive properties in the dataset.\n\n#### Conclusion:\n\nThe `filtered_df.describe()` output provides valuable insights into the New York housing market dataset.

Price Distribution in Key NYC Areas\nThe boxplot below displays the distribution of property prices in four key areas of New York City: New York County, Dumbo, Manhattan, and Brooklyn. A logarithmic scale is used due to the wide range of prices. Key observations include:\n\n- **Range and Variability**: There is a significant range in prices within each area, especially in New York County and Manhattan, indicating a diverse market.\n- **Outliers**: Noticeable outliers are present, particularly in New York County, suggesting the presence of exceptionally high-priced properties.\n- **Comparative Median Prices**: The median price (indicated by the line within each box) varies significantly across these areas, with New York County and Dumbo showing higher medians compared to Manhattan and Brooklyn.\n\n\n\n### 2. Correlation Matrix\nThe heatmap below represents the correlation between price, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and property square footage.\n\n- **Price and Property Size**: There is a moderate positive correlation between price and property square footage, suggesting that larger properties tend to be more expensive.\n- **Bedrooms/Bathrooms and Price**: The number of bedrooms and bathrooms shows a weaker positive correlation with price, indicating these features also contribute to higher prices but may not be as strongly influential as property size.\n- **Bedrooms and Bathrooms Correlation**: A strong correlation between the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, implying that properties with more bedrooms usually have more bathrooms.\n\n\n### Conclusion\nThis deeper analysis reveals the complexity and diversity of the New York City housing market. The wide range of prices and the presence of high-value outliers in certain areas suggest a market with properties catering to various segments, from affordable to luxury. The correlations indicate that while size is a significant factor in determining price, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms also plays a role, though to a lesser extent.
