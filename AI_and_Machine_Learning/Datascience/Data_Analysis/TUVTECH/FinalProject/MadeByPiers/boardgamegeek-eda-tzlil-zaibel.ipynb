This includes selecting games to purchase based on his requests and planned events to attract both board game enthusiasts and amateurs. The world of board games extends beyond the commonly known games like Monopoly, card games, chess, etc., and I hope to shed light on this less explored domain.\n\nThrough this data-driven analysis, I will investigate past and future tendencies in board games. My goal is to provide Mr. Barman with insights and predictions that may benefit his bar in the long term, ensuring its longevity and success.\n\nThis research EDA also serves a personal interest. For me, board games are a medium through which I can connect, engage in social interactions, and strengthen bonds with those around me.\n\n## Key Points\n\n- **Game Acquisition:** When advising Mr. Barman on which games to acquire, I will focus on games released since the 90s, as they are generally easier to obtain.\n- **Research Scope:** For my personal research, I will examine the entire DataFrame to gain a comprehensive understanding of board game trends.\n\nJoin me as we delve into the fascinating world of board games and discover valuable insights that could help shape the future of Mr. Barman's bar.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Importing neccessary packages and libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport ast\nfrom
