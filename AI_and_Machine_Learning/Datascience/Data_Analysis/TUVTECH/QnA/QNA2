### **5. Understanding Reproducibility in Random Number Generation**
**Question:** In the first video of *Case Study: Hacker Statistics*, the topic of reproducibility is discussed. From my understanding, if I generate random numbers, they repeat themselves in every run, meaning there isnâ€™t true randomness. Could someone clarify this concept?  
**Answer:** In programming, random number generators (RNGs) are often deterministic, meaning that if you set a *seed*, the sequence of random numbers remains the same across multiple executions. This ensures reproducibility in experiments.

### **6. Syntax Error Due to Code Formatting**
**Question:** I wrote a line of code where the closing brackets move to a new line, and it keeps throwing an error. How can I fix this?  
**Answer:** Ensure that your indentation and formatting align correctly. Most programming languages require consistent indentation, especially in structured blocks.
