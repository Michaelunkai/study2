1. Congratulations
00:00 - 00:05
Congratulations on completing the course, you've covered a lot!

2. Inspection and validation
00:05 - 00:10
You started off by learning how to inspect and validate data,

3. Aggregation
00:10 - 00:14
before performing aggregation and calculating summary statistics!

4. Address missing data
00:14 - 00:17
You saw how to check for missing values.

5. Address missing data
00:17 - 00:25
You then identified strategies to deal with it, including dropping missing values, and imputation!

6. Analyze categorical data
00:25 - 00:28
You discovered how to create categories from strings,

7. Apply lambda functions
00:28 - 00:37
use lambda functions to conditionally calculate summary statistics based on categories and add values into the original DataFrame,

8. Handle outliers
00:37 - 00:39
and deal with outliers!

9. Patterns over time
00:39 - 00:45
You progressed to examining relationships, including patterns over time,

10. Correlation
00:45 - 00:47
correlation between variables,

11. Distributions
00:47 - 00:49
and interpreting distributions!

12. Cross-tabulation
00:49 - 00:53
In the final chapter you learned the benefits of cross-tabulation,

13. pd.cut()
00:53 - 00:57
generated new features using pd-dot-cut,

14. Data snooping
00:57 - 01:00
and saw the impact of data snooping!

15. Generating hypotheses
01:00 - 01:08
You finished by identifying the limits of EDA and the next step of the data science workflow, hypothesis testing.

16. Next steps
01:08 - 01:21
Now you understand EDA, you may wish to explore some courses that build on the concepts in this course, such as the steps involved in hypothesis testing, or supervised learning, which is a form of machine learning!

17. Congratulations!
01:21 - 01:30
We hope you've enjoyed the course and feel confident in performing exploratory data analysis going forward!
