## Recent Learnings: Exploratory Data Analysis in Python â€“ Chapter 3: Relationships in Data  

### Key Concepts Covered in Your Last Lesson  

During your last session, you focused on handling outliers in datasets. Here's an overview of what you learned:  

#### **Understanding Outliers**  
- **Definition**: Outliers are data points significantly different from the rest of the dataset.  
- **Example**: In a dataset of house prices, a house priced at $5,000,000 may be an outlier if the median is $400,000 unless justified by factors such as location or size.  
- **Impact**: Outliers can skew data analysis, leading to misleading conclusions.  

#### **Identifying Outliers**  
- **Method**: The interquartile range (IQR) was introduced as a mathematical tool to detect outliers.  
  - **IQR Calculation**:  
    \[
    \text{IQR} = Q3 - Q1  
    \]  
    Where \( Q3 \) is the 75th percentile, and \( Q1 \) is the 25th percentile.  
  - **Outlier Thresholds**:  
    \[
    \text{Upper Limit} = Q3 + 1.5 \times \text{IQR}  
    \]  
    \[
    \text{Lower Limit} = Q1 - 1.5 \times \text{IQR}  
    \]  
- **Implementation**: Using these thresholds, outliers were identified programmatically.  

#### **Decision Making on Outliers**  
- **Options**:  
  - Retain the outlier if it's relevant and accurately represents the dataset.  
  - Adjust the value if it's erroneous but important.  
  - Remove the outlier if it adds noise or skews results.  

#### **Impact of Removing Outliers**  
- Removing outliers can often produce a more normally distributed dataset.  
- This adjustment is essential for many statistical analyses and machine learning algorithms.  

### Practical Application  
You practiced:  
- Using visualizations to identify outliers.  
- Applying techniques to remove outliers, ensuring the dataset was prepared for further analysis.  

### Upcoming Lesson  
In the next chapter, you'll focus on improving dataset quality by addressing missing data, an essential step for reliable and accurate analysis.
