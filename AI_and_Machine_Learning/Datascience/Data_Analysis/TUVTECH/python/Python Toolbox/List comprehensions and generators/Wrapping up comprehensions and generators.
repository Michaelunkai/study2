1. Wrapping up comprehensions and generators.
00:00 - 00:18
It's now time to apply your new and hard-won skills. In the following exercises, you'll use list comprehensions to wrangle important information from the time-stamped data of real tweets. I want to remind you of the structure and syntax of a list comprehension:

2. Re-cap: list comprehensions
00:18 - 00:33
in its most basic form, it is enclosed in square brackets and is structured as output expression for iterator variable in iterable. More advanced comprehensions can include conditionals on the output expression and/or conditionals on the iterable.

3. Let's practice!
00:33 - 01:02
After you complete the upcoming exercises, I'll see you in the next Chapter. Therein, we will not teach any new material. We'll be consolidating everything that we've learned so far. This chapter will be dedicated to using the skills you're developing to extract meaningful information from a real-world dataset, the World Bank World Development Indicators dataset. Happy hacking, and see you there!
