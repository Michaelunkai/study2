1. Using pandas' read_csv iterator for streaming data
00:00 - 00:08
You're on the home stretch now! That was some great work with generators to read in large and/or streaming files.

2. Reading files in chunks
00:08 - 00:40
In the remaining exercises, you'll revisit the pandas function read_csv, along with its chunksize argument in order to read in the World Indicator data in chunks, process each chunk and aggregate. Herein, you'll do so in order to look at specific indicators in specific countries and to plot the results over all the years for which the relevant data exists. You'll then try your hand at writing a function to perform the same task which will save so much work when you want to look at the data for a different country.

3. Let's practice!
00:40 - 00:53
Good luck, stay cool and I'll see you again after you explore the data further and consolidate the skills that you've built in these courses. Enjoy!
