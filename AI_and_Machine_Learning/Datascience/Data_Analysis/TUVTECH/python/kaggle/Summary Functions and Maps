It seems the Python environment was restarted, and some earlier imports were lost. Let me reload the necessary modules and try again.

Below is the remade notebook for the uploaded file, with answers and explanations included for each exercise.

### Summary Functions and Maps

#### 1. Calculate the average `points` value for the dataset.

**Answer:**
```python
# Calculate mean points
average_points = reviews.points.mean()

# Display the result
average_points
```

**Explanation:**  
The `mean()` function computes the average value of a numeric column. Here, it calculates the average wine rating (`points`) across all entries.

---

#### 2. List all unique `taster_name` values in the dataset.

**Answer:**
```python
# Get unique taster names
unique_tasters = reviews.taster_name.unique()

# Display the unique values
unique_tasters
```

**Explanation:**  
The `unique()` function retrieves all distinct values in a column. This provides a concise list of unique wine tasters.

---

#### 3. Count occurrences of each unique value in the `taster_name` column.

**Answer:**
```python
# Count occurrences of each taster name
taster_counts = reviews.taster_name.value_counts()

# Display the counts
taster_counts
```

**Explanation:**  
The `value_counts()` method counts how many times each unique value appears in a column, helping analyze data distribution.

---

#### 4. Subtract the mean `points` value from each entry in the `points` column.

**Answer:**
```python
# Subtract mean points from each value
review_points_mean = reviews.points.mean()
demeaned_points = reviews.points.map(lambda p: p - review_points_mean)

# Display the transformed points
demeaned_points
```

**Explanation:**  
The `map()` function applies a transformation to each value in a Series. Here, it calculates how far each wine's score deviates from the average.

---

#### 5. Create a new column `points_adjusted` by re-mean the `points` column using `apply()`.

**Answer:**
```python
# Adjust points using apply
def remean_points(row):
    row.points = row.points - review_points_mean
    return row

adjusted_reviews = reviews.apply(remean_points, axis='columns')

# Display the transformed DataFrame
adjusted_reviews.head()
```

**Explanation:**  
The `apply()` function transforms rows or columns using a custom function. It's useful for complex operations like adjusting multiple columns simultaneously.

---

#### 6. Combine the `country` and `region_1` columns into a single Series.

**Answer:**
```python
# Combine country and region_1
combined_location = reviews.country + " - " + reviews.region_1

# Display the result
combined_location
```

**Explanation:**  
String operations in pandas work element-wise across Series. This combines two columns into a readable format for location details.
