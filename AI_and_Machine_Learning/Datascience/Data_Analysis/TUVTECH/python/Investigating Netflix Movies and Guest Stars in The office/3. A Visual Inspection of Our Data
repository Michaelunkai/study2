### 3. A Visual Inspection of Our Data

**Issue Fix:**
The error occurs due to a typo in the import statement (`metaplotlib.pyplot` instead of `matplotlib.pyplot`). Correcting the import statement will resolve the issue.

**Corrected Answer (Code):**
```python
# Step 1: Import matplotlib.pyplot under its usual alias
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Step 2: Initialize a matplotlib figure
fig = plt.figure()

# Step 3: Create a line plot for years and durations
plt.plot(durations_df['years'], durations_df['durations'])

# Step 4: Add a title to the plot
plt.title("Netflix Movie Durations 2011-2020")

# Step 5: Show the plot
plt.show()
```

Make sure you have `matplotlib` installed in your environment. If you encounter a `ModuleNotFoundError` for `matplotlib`, install it with the following command:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

**Output:**
You will see a line plot with the years (2011â€“2020) on the x-axis and the movie durations on the y-axis, showing trends over the years.
