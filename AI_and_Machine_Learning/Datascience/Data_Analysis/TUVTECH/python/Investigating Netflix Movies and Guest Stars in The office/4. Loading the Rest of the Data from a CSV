### 4. Loading the Rest of the Data from a CSV

**Question:**
Load a CSV file located at `"datasets/netflix_data.csv"` into a DataFrame named `netflix_df`. Print the first five rows of the DataFrame to inspect the data and ensure it was created successfully.

**Answer (Code):**
```python
# Step 1: Import pandas (if not already imported)
import pandas as pd

# Step 2: Load the CSV file into a DataFrame
netflix_df = pd.read_csv("datasets/netflix_data.csv")

# Step 3: Print the first five rows of the DataFrame to inspect
print(netflix_df.head())
```

**Notes:**
- Ensure the file `datasets/netflix_data.csv` is located at the specified path relative to your script or notebook.
- If you encounter a `FileNotFoundError`, confirm that the `datasets` folder exists and contains the `netflix_data.csv` file.

**Expected Output:**
The output will display the first five rows of the `netflix_df` DataFrame, showing a snapshot of the data for inspection.
