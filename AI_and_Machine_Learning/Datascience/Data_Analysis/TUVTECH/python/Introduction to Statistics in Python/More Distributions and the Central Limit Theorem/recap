### Summary of Your Recent Learning

Three hours ago, you completed Chapter 3, **More Distributions and the Central Limit Theorem**, from the course *Introduction to Statistics in Python*. Here's an overview of what you covered during the session:

#### Key Concepts:

1. **Normal Distribution**:
   - A fundamental statistical concept often represented as a "bell curve."
   - Defined by:
     - **Mean**: Determines the center.
     - **Standard Deviation**: Dictates the spread.
   - Properties:
     - Symmetrical shape.
     - Total area under the curve equals 1.
     - The **68-95-99.7 Rule**: 
       - 68% of data lies within 1 standard deviation of the mean.
       - 95% within 2.
       - 99.7% within 3.

2. **Applications in Real-World Data**:
   - Example: The normal distribution observed in datasets like women’s heights from health surveys.
   - Practical use: Calculating probabilities for data within specified ranges using the `norm.cdf` function from `scipy.stats`.

3. **Hands-On Practice**:
   - Analyzed Amir's sales data:
     - Determined sales distribution.
     - Calculated probabilities for specific sales outcomes.
   - Simulated sales under modified market conditions:
     - Adjusted mean and standard deviation to reflect changes.
     - Visualized results with histograms.

#### Code Example:
Simulating new sales data:

```python
from scipy.stats import norm
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Updated market conditions
new_mean = 5000 * 1.2  # Adjusted mean
new_sd = 2000 * 1.3    # Adjusted standard deviation

# Generate new sales data
new_sales = norm.rvs(new_mean, new_sd, size=36)

# Visualize with histogram
plt.hist(new_sales)
plt.show()
```

This exercise enhanced your ability to analyze and interpret data that follows a normal distribution—an essential skill for statistical analysis and data science.

#### Next Lesson:
You will delve into the **Central Limit Theorem**, focusing on estimating population parameters from sample data.
