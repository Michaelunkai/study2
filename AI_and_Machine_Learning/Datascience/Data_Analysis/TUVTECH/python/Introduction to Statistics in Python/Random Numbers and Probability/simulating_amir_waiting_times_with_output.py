# Question:
# Generate 1000 wait times from the continuous uniform distribution that models Amir's wait time between 0 and 30 minutes.
# Assign the simulated data to the variable `wait_times`, and print the values.

# Explanation:
# Using a uniform distribution, simulate Amir's waiting time across 1000 trials, with a minimum of 0 and maximum of 30 minutes.
# Store the simulated data in a variable `wait_times`, then visualize the results as a histogram to observe the distribution.

# Full Answer (Code):
# Step 1: Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import uniform

# Step 2: Set the random seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(334)

# Step 3: Define the minimum and maximum wait times
min_time = 0
max_time = 30

# Step 4: Generate 1000 wait times using scipy.stats.uniform
wait_times = uniform.rvs(loc=min_time, scale=max_time - min_time, size=1000)

# Step 5: Print the generated wait times
print(wait_times)

# Step 6: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution
plt.hist(wait_times, bins=15, edgecolor='black', color='skyblue')
plt.title('Simulated Waiting Times for Amir (Using scipy.stats.uniform)')
plt.xlabel('Waiting Time (minutes)')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.grid(axis='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)
plt.show()

# Answer Explanation:
# The scipy.stats.uniform.rvs function generates 1000 waiting times evenly distributed between 0 and 30 minutes.
# Assigning these values to `wait_times` ensures they are accessible for further analysis or visualization.
# The histogram confirms uniform distribution, showing that all wait times in the specified range are equally probable.
