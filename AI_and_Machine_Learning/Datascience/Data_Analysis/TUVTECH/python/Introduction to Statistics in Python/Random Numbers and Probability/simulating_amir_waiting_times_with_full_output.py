# Question:
# To better understand Amir's waiting times, simulate 1000 waiting times from a uniform distribution between 0 and 30 minutes.
# Store the values in `wait_times`, print the output, and plot a histogram to visualize the distribution.

# Explanation:
# Simulating Amir's waiting time across 1000 trials with uniform distribution provides insights into possible wait durations.
# Printing the values helps verify the data, while a histogram graphically confirms equal probabilities across the interval from 0 to 30 minutes.

# Full Answer (Code):
# Step 1: Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import uniform

# Step 2: Set the random seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(334)

# Step 3: Define the minimum and maximum wait times
min_time = 0
max_time = 30

# Step 4: Generate 1000 wait times using scipy.stats.uniform
wait_times = uniform.rvs(loc=min_time, scale=max_time - min_time, size=1000)

# Step 5: Print the generated wait times
print(wait_times)

# Step 6: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution
plt.hist(wait_times, bins=15, edgecolor='black', color='skyblue')
plt.title('Simulated Waiting Times for Amir (Using scipy.stats.uniform)')
plt.xlabel('Waiting Time (minutes)')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.grid(axis='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)
plt.show()

# Answer Explanation:
# Simulating wait times using `scipy.stats.uniform.rvs` creates 1000 values between 0 and 30 minutes.
# Printing ensures accurate data generation, while the histogram confirms the uniform distribution, with equally likely
# durations visualized by consistent frequencies across intervals. This verifies Amir's wait times follow a continuous, evenly distributed pattern.
