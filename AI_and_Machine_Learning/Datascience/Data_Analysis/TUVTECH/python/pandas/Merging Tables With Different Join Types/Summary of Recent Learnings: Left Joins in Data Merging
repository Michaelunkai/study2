### Summary of Recent Learnings: Left Joins in Data Merging

**Topic Covered**: *Merging Tables with Different Join Types (Chapter 2, "Joining Data with pandas")*

In your last session, you focused on understanding and applying **left joins** in data merging. Hereâ€™s a concise overview of what you learned:

---

**Key Concepts of Left Joins**:
- A **left join** includes all rows from the left table and matches rows from the right table where key columns align. Missing values in the right table are filled with `NaN` for unmatched rows.
- Left joins are performed using the `merge` method in pandas, with the argument `how='left'`.

**Highlights**:
1. **Retaining All Rows from the Left Table**:
   - After a left join, the resulting table contains all rows from the left table.
   - For one-to-one relationships, the number of rows in the merged table equals the left table.

2. **Practical Applications**:
   - Identifying Missing Data:
     - Example: Merging the `movies` table with the `financials` table to find movies lacking financial information.
   - Enriching Datasets:
     - Example: Adding marketing taglines to a dataset of Toy Story movies to enhance its details.

**Code Example**:  
Performing a left join to merge datasets:
```python
merged_data = movies.merge(taglines, on='ID', how='left')
```
- Merges the `movies` table with the `taglines` table based on the `ID` column.
- Ensures all rows from the `movies` table are included in the result.

**Next Steps**:
The upcoming lesson will focus on techniques for **analyzing and visualizing merged data** to uncover insights effectively.
