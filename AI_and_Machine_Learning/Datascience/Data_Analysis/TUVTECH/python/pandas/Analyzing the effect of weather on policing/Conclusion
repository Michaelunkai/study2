You've built a great foundation of pandas knowledge, but there's a lot more to learn. The best way to improve your skills is to practice answering questions using data. For example, you can download the traffic stop data for Rhode Island and 30 other states from the Stanford Open Policing Project's website. There are many more interesting questions you can answer using this data.
