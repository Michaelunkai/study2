# Recent Learnings: Visual Exploratory Data Analysis

In your last session, you worked on Chapter 3 of the course *Analyzing Police Activity with pandas*. Here's a concise summary of the key concepts and techniques you learned:

---

## Key Learnings:

### **1. Resampling Time Series Data**
- **Purpose:** Modify the frequency of time-series data.
- **Example:**  
  Resampling the `price` column by month ('M') and calculating the mean provides the average price for each month.
  ```python
  monthly_price = apple['price'].resample('M').mean()
  ```

---

### **2. Combining Resampled Data**
- **Technique:** Use the `concat()` function to combine multiple resampled datasets into a single DataFrame.  
- **Example:**  
  ```python
  monthly_volume = apple['volume'].resample('M').mean()
  monthly = pd.concat([monthly_price, monthly_volume], axis='columns')
  ```

---

### **3. Visualizing Data Trends**
- **Line Plots:** Useful for visualizing relationships between variables over time.
- **Subplots:** When variables have different scales, set `subplots=True` for clearer insights.
  ```python
  monthly.plot(subplots=True)
  plt.show()
  ```

---

### **4. Practical Application: Analyzing Police Activity**
- **Drug-Related Stops:** Calculated the annual rate of drug-related stops using the `drugs_related_stop` column. Visualized trends over time using line plots.
  ```python
  annual_drug_rate = drugs_related_stop.resample('Y').mean()
  annual_drug_rate.plot()
  plt.show()
  ```

- **Comparing Rates:** Compared annual drug rates with search rates by resampling `search_conducted`, concatenating results, and creating subplots.
  ```python
  annual_search_rate = search_conducted.resample('Y').mean()
  comparison = pd.concat([annual_drug_rate, annual_search_rate], axis='columns')
  comparison.plot(subplots=True)
  plt.show()
  ```

These techniques enhance your ability to understand and visualize trends within datasets effectively.
