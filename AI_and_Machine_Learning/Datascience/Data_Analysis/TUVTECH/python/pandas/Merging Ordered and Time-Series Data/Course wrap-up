3. Data merging basics
00:19 - 00:37
In chapter one, you performed an inner join with the default settings using the merge() method. You also learned about the different types of table relationships and merging multiple tables. These are the basics of using the combining data with the merge() method.

4. Merging tables with different join types
00:37 - 00:51
In the second chapter, you expanded your joining skills to many different types of joins. You also learned how to merge a table to itself and how to merge using indexes.

5. Advanced merging and concatenating
00:51 - 01:05
In the third chapter, you learned about filtering joins, such as semi- and anti joins. You also learned how to combine data vertically with the concat() method and about the importance of data integrity.

6. Merging ordered and time-series data
01:05 - 01:18
In the last chapter you discovered how to merge ordered and time-series data with merge_ordered() and merge_asof(). In the last lesson, you learned how to use melt().

7. Thank you!
