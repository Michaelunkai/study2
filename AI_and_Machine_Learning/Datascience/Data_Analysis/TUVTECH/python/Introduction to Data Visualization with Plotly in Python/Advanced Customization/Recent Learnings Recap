**Topic:** Customizing Plots  
**Course:** *Introduction to Data Visualization with Plotly in Python* (Chapter 2)  

In your last lesson, you focused on enhancing Plotly visualizations by adding **annotations** to provide context or highlight specific data points. Hereâ€™s an overview of what you covered:

#### Key Learnings:
1. **Purpose of Annotations**  
   - Annotations are textual elements added to plots to emphasize particular data points or include explanatory text directly in the visualization.  
   - They enhance the clarity and narrative power of your charts.  

2. **Adding Annotations**  
   - You used the `update_layout()` method with its `annotations` argument to add one or more annotations.  
   - This method provides flexibility and ensures consistency with other plot adjustments.  

3. **Annotation Object Components**  
   Each annotation is defined as a dictionary with key arguments:  
   - **`showarrow`:** Boolean to toggle an arrow pointing to a data point.  
   - **`text`:** The content of the annotation, supporting variables and text.  
   - **`x` and `y`:** Coordinates for positioning the annotation, either linked to data points or set absolutely.  
   - **`xref` and `yref`:** Reference for coordinates:
     - Set to `'paper'` to position annotations based on the plot area using a scale of 0 to 1.  

4. **Practical Application**  
   - You practiced these concepts by:  
     - Annotating a **savings balance bar chart** to explain significant changes.  
     - Adding a **positive message** to a histogram of company revenues.  
   - Example Code: Adding annotations to a figure:  
     ```python
     fig.update_layout({'annotations': [loss_annotation, gain_annotation]})
     ```

#### Outcome:
This lesson equipped you with the skills to make your Plotly visualizations more engaging and informative through effective use of annotations.
