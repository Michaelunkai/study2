1. Dropdowns
00:00 - 00:06
Let's extend our knowledge of buttons to create dropdown menus in Plotly with Python.

2. What is a dropdown?
00:06 - 00:32
A dropdown menu is a way of providing user input to select between different options, much like the buttons you previously created. You can create as many options as you like in Plotly that update data or layout elements. See the example here to the right. Here is a dropdown with four options. These would trigger some change in the plot it is on.

3. Dropdowns in Plotly
00:32 - 01:12
Dropdowns are created very similarly to buttons. Let's create a figure object, then loop through our DataFrame of Sydney property prices in several suburbs across 2015 and 2020. We subset the DataFrame each time as we want to create different plots with different data subsets. In each iteration, we'll add a bar chart that uses that specific subset, setting the name of the trace to be the suburb of interest. Why are we adding so many traces? A common way to utilize dropdowns and buttons is to show or hide specific traces.

4. Hiding a trace
01:12 - 01:51
Remember what we can update in a figure's data elements? There was a lot! The visible argument to each trace sets whether it is shown or not. We could therefore use args to effectively switch between traces by making some visible and others not. For example, in this dropdown button, we set the args dictionary to send a list of True/False to the visible argument of each trace Since we used a list for the args value, it will update all 3 traces, effectively only showing the first one. Neat huh!

5. The dropdown object
01:51 - 02:09
You'll notice the dropdown object is very similar to the buttons object We have added a title as well to the args list. We are also going to alter the visible argument of our traces to show or hide depending on which is selected

6. Adding the dropdown
02:09 - 02:24
Adding the dropdown to the graph is very similar. We have simply changed the type to 'dropdown' and removed the button-specific 'direction' argument. Here is our dropdown in action - nice!

Let's practice adding dropdown menus to our visualizations.
