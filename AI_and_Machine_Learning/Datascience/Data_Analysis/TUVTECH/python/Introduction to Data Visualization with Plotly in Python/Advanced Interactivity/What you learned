In chapter 1 you learned about the Plotly Figure and created and styled some basic visualizations including univariate visualizations such as box plots and histograms. You also learned how to customize the color of your plots.

3. Chapter 2
00:22 - 00:43
In Chapter 2 you expanded your toolkit with bivariate visualizations and learned how to customize your plots further by adding, placing, and customizing hover information, legends and annotations. Additionally, you learned how to customize plot axes.

4. Chapter 3
00:43 - 01:01
In chapter 3, your plotly skills really took off as you learned advanced customization including subplots of the same or different types, how to layer multiple plots on the same chart, and how to create basic time buttons for line charts.

5. Chapter 4
01:01 - 01:21
Finally, in Chapter 4 you unleashed the really cool interactive elements that Plotly has to offer, taking your plots from static images to truly interactive experiences. You created buttons, dropdown menus, and sliders to toggle your visualizations.
