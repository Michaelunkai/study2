Your recent learnings
When you left 2 days ago, you worked on Fetching, ranking, and paging, chapter 2 of the course PostgreSQL Summary Stats and Window Functions. Here is what you covered in your last lesson:

You learned about the use of PARTITION BY in window functions, a powerful SQL feature that allows you to segment your data into partitions for more granular analysis. This is particularly useful when working with functions like LAG or ROW_NUMBER() to ensure accurate calculations within each partition. Key points covered include:

Understanding PARTITION BY: You discovered how PARTITION BY creates partitions in your data based on the unique values of specified columns, allowing window functions to operate on each partition independently.
Difference from GROUP BY: Unlike GROUP BY, which aggregates rows, PARTITION BY keeps the detail of each row but allows for window functions to consider each partition separately.
Practical Examples: Through exercises, you applied PARTITION BY to solve problems like correctly identifying previous champions in sports data by partitioning results by gender, event, and year. This ensures that calculations like LAG only consider rows within the same partition, preventing data mix-up across categories.
Here's a snippet from one of the exercises, demonstrating how to fetch the previous year's champion by gender using PARTITION BY:

SELECT
  Gender, Year,
  Country AS Champion,
  LAG(Country) OVER (PARTITION BY Gender ORDER BY Year ASC) AS Last_Champion
FROM Tennis_Gold
ORDER BY Gender ASC, Year ASC;
This lesson equipped you with the knowledge to effectively segment your SQL queries for more precise and accurate data analysis using window functions.

The goal of the next lesson is to explore advanced techniques of window functions in SQL, including how to perform calculations over specific partitions of data and utilize different types of window functions for more complex data analysis tasks.
