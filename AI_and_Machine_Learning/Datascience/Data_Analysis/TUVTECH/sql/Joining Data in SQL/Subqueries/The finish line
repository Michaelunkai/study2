1. The finish line
00:00 - 00:11
Congratulations on making it to the end of the course, and well done learning so many ways to join data! Let's do a rapid round-up of everything we've learned.

2. Types of joins
00:11 - 00:35
We talked a lot about joins. In SQL, a join combines columns from one or more tables in a relational database via a lookup process. We learned about INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN, and CROSS JOIN. We also learned about semi joins, anti joins, and self joins.

3. Set operations
00:35 - 00:40
We also covered a different way of joining data in SQL: set operations.

4. Types of basic subqueries
00:40 - 00:54
Lastly, we covered subquerying, which is covered in more detail in later SQL courses by DataCamp. We saw subquerying inside the SELECT, WHERE and FROM clauses.

5. WHERE to from here?
00:54 - 01:16
If you'd like to continue on your journey to becoming a SQL pro, we recommend you take the SQL course listed. If you would like to continue practicing joining data, have a look at some projects, practice exercises and competitions. Alternatively, head to Workspace to build a portfolio of your own projects!

6. The finish line!
01:16 - 01:27
Good luck on your future endeavors. Look around and you will find that table joins are all around you! Thanks for sticking with it.
