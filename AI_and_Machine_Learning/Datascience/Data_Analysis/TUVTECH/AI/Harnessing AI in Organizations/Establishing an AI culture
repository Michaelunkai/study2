00:00 - 00:23
Congratulations on making it this far! Now that you got a solid grasp of AI foundations, its areas, and the types of problems it can help address, it is time to dive deep into understanding how to activate AI in organizational, business, and industry contexts. And the first step is to establish an AI culture in your organization.

2. The value of AI in organizations
00:23 - 00:32
You might be wondering: why and how can AI add value to organizations? There are multiple motivations.

3. The value of AI in organizations
00:32 - 00:39
An AI-driven company is more likely to adopt a more advantageous position against competitors.

4. The value of AI in organizations
00:39 - 00:50
AI contributes to reducing operational costs, be it by collecting valuable data for strategic decision-making, automating tasks, and optimizing workflows.

00:50 - 00:54
It can help increase revenue and employee efficiency.

00:54 - 01:00
It also brings an improved customer experience by better aligning with their expectations.

7. The value of AI in organizations
01:00 - 01:26
And it can even assist in the design, development, and delivery of better products and services. Take AI personalization in retail as an example: an AI solution that identifies the individual shopping habits of customers and delivers personalized offers, may increase customer loyalty and sales, positively impacting customer experience, revenue, and competitive advantage.

8. Building an AI-driven organization
01:26 - 01:42
Once we realize the value that AI brings to an organization, what are the required building blocks? The first one is establishing a roadmap for AI adoption, by obtaining leadership support and a clear vision.

9. Building an AI-driven organization
01:42 - 01:50
Next, we must develop a data strategy plan to collect, utilize, and govern relevant data for AI initiatives.

10. Building an AI-driven organization
01:50 - 02:00
Likewise, we need to invest in scalable computing infrastructure and AI tools, be it on-premise or with cloud providers.

11. Building an AI-driven organization
02:00 - 02:09
A well-founded infrastructure would be a hollow shell without hiring qualified roles with the required AI and Machine Learning expertise to handle it.

12. Building an AI-driven organization
02:09 - 02:20
The most successful AI projects are those where cross-functional collaboration is encouraged, rather than remaining siloed in tech departments or teams.

13. Building an AI-driven organization
02:20 - 02:29
It is imperative to use AI developments to drive business success, for example building customer-centric products or increasing revenue.

14. Building an AI-driven organization
02:29 - 02:38
And because AI is a constantly evolving discipline, continuous learning, and AI literacy among people should be promoted.

15. Building an AI-driven organization
02:38 - 02:51
Finally, everything must be underpinned by policies for the ethical and responsible use of AI and data, starting with robust security measures, and principles for responsible and transparent AI systems.

16. Building an AI-driven organization
02:51 - 03:01
These 8 elements can be simplified into 3 dimensions: business, data and infrastructure, and people and culture.

17. AI-driven organization: roadmap
03:01 - 03:08
Let's illustrate how a roadmap should look like to turn an organization AI-driven.

18. AI-driven organization: roadmap
03:08 - 03:18
First, we must assess the current state of our organization or target business area, and set objectives aligned with strategic goals or current business needs.

19. AI-driven organization: roadmap
03:18 - 03:25
Next, we will plan and build the right team, infrastructure, and data readiness.

20. AI-driven organization: roadmap
03:25 - 03:38
After that, it's time to kick-start pilot AI projects, iterate and scale its adoption in our products and services, fostering continuous learning while ensuring data governance and ethics.

21. Let's practice!
03:38 - 03:43
Let's consolidate these principles with some practical exercises.
