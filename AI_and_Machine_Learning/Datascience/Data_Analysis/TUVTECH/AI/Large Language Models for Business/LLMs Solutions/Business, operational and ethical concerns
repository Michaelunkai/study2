1. Business, operational and ethical concerns
00:00 - 00:09
Let’s now take some time to consider the business, operational, and ethical concerns that could arise with the use of LLMs in business.

2. Transparency
00:09 - 00:29
One of the pivotal concerns surrounding LLMs is transparency. Businesses must understand the model's reasoning when an LLM recommends a particular business strategy or solution. This transparency is essential for trust and ensuring that the decisions made are well-informed and based on solid grounds.

3. Accountability
00:29 - 00:49
Another significant issue is accountability. When an LLM's recommendation doesn't pan out as expected, or worse, results in a business setback, the pressing question arises: who bears the responsibility? Is it the software developers who designed the model or the company that deployed it in their operations?

4. The risks with LLMs
00:49 - 01:21
But the challenges continue. There's an inherent risk with LLMs where they might unintentionally propagate or amplify misinformation. This could lead to businesses basing decisions on incorrect or misleading data, potentially affecting their bottom line or reputation. Furthermore, there's a lurking danger of these models being weaponized by malicious entities with intentions to deceive, manipulate, or mislead stakeholders, creating both reputational and operational risks.

5. LLMs and the environment
01:21 - 01:45
Lastly, there's an environmental angle to consider beyond the ethical and operational dimensions. The extensive computational power required to train LLMs consumes significant energy, leaving a substantial carbon footprint. As businesses look to adopt LLMs, understanding and mitigating these environmental impacts becomes paramount.

6. How to build LLMs?
01:45 - 02:01
Following the ethical concerns of large language models (LLMs), there are also pragmatic considerations for businesses to weigh. Whether to build an in-house LLM or rely on third-party providers is a crucial decision that involves several trade-offs.

7. Technological resources
02:01 - 02:27
Building an LLM in-house requires significant resources – from computational infrastructure to domain-specific data. Organizations need to evaluate whether they can make such an investment, both financially and in terms of time. Relying on a third-party model can mitigate these concerns, as they often provide immediate access and scalability without development overheads.

8. Personalized LLMs
02:27 - 02:49
In-house development allows businesses to tailor the LLM to their specific needs. This can result in a model fine-tuned to a company's domain, potentially offering more accurate and relevant results. On the other hand, third-party models, while sophisticated, might be more generic unless they offer customization options.

9. Updates and maintenance
02:49 - 03:07
Like all technologies, language models require regular updates and maintenance to remain effective and secure. This can impose an ongoing cost for businesses. Outsourcing to a third party might absolve companies of this responsibility, passing it to the provider.

10. Handling data
03:07 - 03:24
With in-house development, businesses maintain complete control over their data, which can be crucial for those handling sensitive information. Using third-party models might entail sharing data externally, leading to potential security and privacy risks.

11. Cost efficiency
03:24 - 03:42
Balancing the reoccurring costs of third-party services with an in-house model is also a key challenge to ensure that implementing an LLM is cost-effective over time. Generally, the start-up costs of a third-party system are quite low compared to the much higher initial cost of an in-house model.

12. The choice is yours!
03:42 - 03:56
The choice between in-house and third-party LLMs is multifaceted. Businesses must consider LLMs carefully to achieve their objectives and utilize their overarching AI strategy as guidance.

13. Let's practice!
03:56 - 04:00
Ok now, it's exercise time.
