1. Enhancing existing workflows with LLMs
00:00 - 00:11
Hello again! Having introduced you to the journey and rise of LLMs, it’s time to discover how LLMs help improve and solve issues with business workflows.

2. LLMs and businesses
00:11 - 00:50
Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming invaluable assets in today's dynamic business landscape. Due to the deep learning techniques of LLMs, they can be used across many sectors and different companies, from finance to healthcare. These AI algorithms can be trained on extensive datasets across many industries to streamline processes and enable data-driven decision-making. Finding ways to implement LLMs into existing workflows will help boost efficiency, gain insights, and stay ahead in an increasingly competitive world.

8. Use cases
01:03 - 01:13
For this lesson, we will focus on workflow automation since this is a key area many businesses can leverage LLMs safely and effectively.

9. Easy workflow enhancement
01:13 - 01:38
You might think that it would take a lot of effort to implement LLMs into already existing workflows. A business would have to scrap everything and start again! Luckily, this isn't the case. So, let’s look at a few potential use cases of how LLMs can enhance existing workflows and help you determine if utilizing an LLM is right for your workflow.

10. Where to begin?
01:38 - 01:55
LLMs excel at so many different tasks it's hard to know where to begin. For organizations, starting summarization and personalization are significant use cases to accelerate and augment current manual flows.

11. To infinity and beyond!
01:55 - 02:50
For our first scenario, we will utilize a fictional company, Celestial Voyages (CVTA), a travel agency that curates unique global adventures for its clients. To manage the influx of inquiries about destination details, travel tips, and itineraries, CVTA integrates an LLM into its customer contact system. The LLM can promptly summarize extensive travel guides, hotel reviews, and cultural documentation to give travelers concise and essential highlights. A trusted travel agent can review the highlights and respond quickly to clients. By understanding the question and summarizing a potential trip, the LLM can tackle ordinary requests and allow the travel agent to work on more intricate and rewarding itineraries.

12. Personalized responses
02:50 - 03:11
Pivoting to personalization, LLMs are popping up as fantastic tools for marketing and customer outreach. Instead of relying on generic information, automatically created assets like these ones from Google’s ad platform dynamically adjust to provide a personalized experience for customers.

13. To use or not to use?
03:11 - 03:58
Knowing when to leverage an LLM and when not to is challenging; the best set of guidelines is that not every process needs an LLM to supercharge it. LLMs are specialized tools that fit into specific use cases. To start, look for two things: repetitive language tasks like understanding a customer’s question and drafting a response or areas where it would be impractical to scale with traditional human processes like responding to every search result with a custom-created marketing response. LLMs are amazing tools, and conquering these two areas will allow you to understand the opportunity of LLMs and move into more advanced and evolving frontiers.
