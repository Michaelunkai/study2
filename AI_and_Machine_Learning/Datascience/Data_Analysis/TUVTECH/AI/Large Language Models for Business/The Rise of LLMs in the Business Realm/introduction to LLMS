4. Let's talk LLMs
01:03 - 01:36
One of the most exciting branches of AI emerging today is Large Language Models, or LLMs. These models are designed to understand and generate human-like text, revolutionizing communication, content creation, and data interpretation. Have you ever chatted with an exceptionally responsive AI chatbot while shopping online or sought assistance with tasks like booking or canceling flight tickets? The capabilities of LLMs often power those enhanced interactions.

5. Who put the 'Large' in LLMs?
01:36 - 02:14
You might wonder, "Why are they termed 'large'?" The "large" in Large Language Models isn't just a fanciful descriptor. LLMs are named for their extensive scale, both in the sheer volume of data they're trained on and the computational resources they demand during this process. Beyond the technical aspects, the "large" also reflects their vast capabilities, which enable them to understand and generate human-like text with remarkable accuracy and nuance. It symbolizes their power and potential to reshape our interactions with technology.

6. Revolutionizing language processing
02:14 - 02:55
Traditionally, while AI excelled at tasks like recommending content based on your history, it had limitations in understanding language contextually or answering open-ended questions. LLMs have changed the game. They can process language similarly to humans, which is revolutionary. Take, for example, the GPT series by OpenAI. It's one of the most buzzed-about tools in the LLM family, renowned for its impressive ability to engage in almost human-like conversations. And more powerful language processors emerge daily, expanding the realm of possibilities.
