1. The journey of LLMs
00:00 - 00:10
In this video, let's journey through the evolution of LLMs – from their foundational principles to their transformative role in businesses today.

2. From humble beginnings
00:10 - 00:39
The large language models have had a fascinating journey from the humble beginnings of text-based algorithms to the transformative forces driving businesses today. Back then, computers were elementary and could only understand simple codes. They couldn't understand human language to a good extent. But as technology improved, some people started asking: what if computers could understand our language and create sentences just like us?

3. Early LLM models
00:39 - 01:11
That idea led to the creation of the first LLMs. These early models were basic but showed promise. They could recognize simple language patterns. As advancements continued, the features of LLMs got improved. They began to understand more about the context of sentences, leading to more precise and more valuable outputs. They became helpful in many areas, like helping with customer questions or giving insights into business areas like finance.

4. Move quickly, but sustainably
01:11 - 01:32
Today, businesses need fast and effective tools. So, there's a big push to make LLMs work faster and use less energy. This is great for businesses because they can get answers quickly and save money. In addition, it's a step towards using technology in a way that's more sustainable for our planet.

5. Challenges
01:32 - 01:53
However, the journey wasn’t without challenges. As LLMs interacted with diverse data from the web, they faced issues related to biases and accuracy. The AI community rallied around these challenges, seeking solutions to ensure that LLMs not only provided valuable information but did so responsibly.

6. Entering the arts
01:53 - 02:18
Another intriguing fact about LLMs is that they've started to delve into the creativity realm. They’ve ventured into art, music, and literature. But it's important to remember that they lack the feel emotions like we do. They see patterns in the data. Some new projects are trying to make LLMs understand feelings better, which could cause our interactions with them to feel more natural.

7. New opportunities
02:18 - 02:37
The world of LLMs is constantly changing and getting better. This means new opportunities and tools are always on the horizon for businesses. The story of LLMs shows how far we've come in making machines understand us. It's an exciting time with a lot of possibilities.
