1. Enhancing workflows with AI
00:00 - 00:14
Now that you’ve grasped some basic ideas of generative AI, you might be wondering how we could harness it to improve our workflow. Let's discuss some ways a business can accomplish that.

2. Style Synchrony
00:14 - 00:52
Style Synchrony, a fictional fashion marketing company, excels in creating captivating narratives that emphasize the beauty and individuality of each fashion line they represent, maintaining those narratives consistently across all media platforms. They’ve recently begun implementing AI technology, specifically a generative AI assistant, with the hope of enhancing their existing workflow. Let’s examine how this generative AI assistant could give Style Synchrony a competitive edge.

3. Generative AI Assistant: Augmentation
00:52 - 01:20
First, the assistant enables augmentation, meaning it can complete parts of a human task. Let's say Style Synchrony needs to create a promotional video for a fashion brand during the Black Friday sales; the generative AI assistant could generate a list of potential concept options. Then a human employee selects a key idea and brings it to fruition.

4. Generative AI Assistant: Co-creation
01:20 - 01:54
Next is co-creation, where humans and AI collaborate, even engage in a dialogue, to generate a finished product. Suppose now Style Synchrony needs to present the promotional video to the client and needs to prepare a slide deck for a stronger pitch. The generative AI assistant and a human employee might converse about what information should be presented in the slide deck. The AI can even help to generate a cohesive and engaging narrative.

5. Generative AI Assistant: Replacement
01:54 - 02:30
Finally, we have replacement. This is the scenario where the AI fully automates a task, eliminating the need for proactive human intervention. How can this happen? The AI assistant can shift through vast amounts of data and capture emerging micro-trends on social media. The AI can analyze historical fashion trends and compare with the current global style patterns. This will help Style Synchrony monitor the impact of the promotional video and better guide their client.

6. Successful human and AI collaboration
02:30 - 03:30
So, how did Style Synchrony successfully enable human and AI collaboration? What steps should other businesses consider to replicate their success story? First off, Style Synchrony began by identifying and mapping processes and tasks. This typically involved manual, resource-intensive tasks like tracking metrics, brainstorming innovative concepts and create process workflows. By mapping these tasks and dissecting them, they could identify where the AI assistant could be valuable. Style Synchrony discovered which components could be automated or augmented by the AI. This crucial step helped them determine how the AI could be integrated into their existing processes to improve workflow efficiency, without sacrificing the quality of the end products.

7. Test and deploy
03:30 - 04:14
Next, they put their AI solution through a trial run. First of all - train a small team if necessary. They observed how the AI integrated with the team, the quality of the assigned tasks, and made necessary adjustments based on employee feedback. Secondly, they deployed the solution to a wider group and monitored its performance. For instance, the Creative Director could use the AI assistant to brainstorm concept art for several projects and then assess how much faster these concepts can be created as a result. By keeping a close eye on the AI's performance, they could continually optimize its use and maximize its benefits.

8. Generative AI in workflows
04:14 - 05:15
Generative AI ushers in a new way of working. Instead of viewing these advanced tools as competitors, we can regard AI as a collaborator, a source of inspiration, and a helper to accomplish routine tasks. As technology rapidly evolves, we need to stay abreast of the latest trends in generative AI within our sectors. But don't worry - many AI tools are designed to teach and explain, helping us learn faster than we ever thought possible. Lastly, we need to implement change management principles and exercise patience. The capabilities of generative AI are vast, but AIs process information differently from humans. Introducing AI is akin to welcoming a new team member - it takes time and shared experiences to achieve the most effective collaboration. Implementing continuous improvement principles can help you get the most out of AI.

9. Let's practice!
