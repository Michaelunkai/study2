1. The next level
00:00 - 00:15
Welcome to the edge of our conversational AI journey. We’re going to take a glimpse at the seamless integration of ChatGPT into our daily tasks. The upcoming chapters will unfold the capabilities of this tool, transforming the way we engage with information.

2. Infusing persona
00:15 - 00:25
When writing prompts, adopting a persona is sometimes helpful. Let’s ask ChatGPT to write a speech to give an address at my university.

3. Infusing persona
00:25 - 00:31
As a result, the output is quite generic. It doesn’t know which writing style to follow.

4. Infusing persona
00:31 - 00:38
Instead of relying on a generic output, we can ask our trusty friend Ernest Hemingway to write a speech for us.

00:38 - 00:47
This can help influence output style, audience, length and tone. Four variables we can control to help reach our desired response.

6. Making it personal
00:47 - 01:03
Soon, you'll see ChatGPT craft emails that echo your personal writing style. Providing examples to ChatGPT is a great way for the model to emulate your writing style. This makes every response resonate with your unique voice.

7. Useful ways to structure your prompt
01:03 - 01:22
Throughout this course we’ll learn how to use markdown, an elegant way of structuring text. In addition, the correct use of quotation marks and delimiters will lead to a more tailored input. These are two smart tools you can use that will help remove ambiguity from your prompt, turning a good question into a great one.

8. Training techniques
01:22 - 01:38
We'll explore how to harness zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot learning to guide ChatGPT towards crafting responses that feel personal and intuitive, whether it's recommending movies based on your preferences or mirroring output style.

9. Training techniques
01:38 - 01:43
Example Teaser: "If my favorite films are 'Gladiator' and 'Sex and the City', what other movies should I watch?"

10. Training techniques
01:43 - 01:50
This will lead ChatGPT to offer you a curated watch list, as if from a trusted friend.

11. Training techniques
01:50 - 02:02
ChatGPT’s powers really come alive when we can blend individual interests of wildly different genres. ChatGPT help discern those preferences and offer advice accordingly.

12. A helping hand for problem-solving
02:02 - 02:37
Beginning to solve a problem alone can often seem like a monumental task. You’re often left scratching your head. Luckily, a technique called ‘chain-of-thought’ prompting can turn ChatGPT into your helpful assistant. Chain-of-thought works by getting ChatGPT to break down a task into its subsequent steps. This can be done via (i) Zero-shot. Not providing any examples and asking ChatGPT for the problem-solving guide, or (ii) One/few-shot. Providing one or more examples of a framework that ChatGPT can use to tackle the problem.

13. Limitations
02:37 - 03:03
As with any tool, ChatGPT has its limitations. Understanding these conditions will help you recognise things like: Biases — The model presents stereotypes or misinformation Hallucinations — The model confidently states incorrect information Overfitting — The model is only as good as the data it's trained on Building a discerning eye for these shortcomings will help you get the most out of ChatGPT.

14. Anticipating complex workflows
03:03 - 03:15
We'll learn to build complex workflows, chaining prompts that guide ChatGPT through multi-step tasks, from drafting business plans to developing content strategies, all tailored to our scenarios.

15. Anticipating complex workflows
03:15 - 03:31
"Let's draft a startup plan focused on sustainable technology," will be our entry point into creating sophisticated, multi-part responses that mirror a strategic consultancy session. We can layer this with asks to ChatGPT for frameworks and resources that would’ve otherwise been overlooked.

16. Let's practice!
03:31 - 04:01
The techniques we'll uncover will not just answer our questions but will expand the scope of what we can ask. The prompts we craft today will evolve into a sophisticated dialogue with AI, shaping the way we think, work, and solve problems. We’ll transition from asking "What can ChatGPT do for me?" to “What can’t ChatGPT do for me?” It’s time to push the frontier of conversational AI and dive into the exercises.
