I want to lose fat and gain muscle. But I don't know how. I can start by asking ChatGPT to give me a list of foods I should eat.

We start by writing our text, hitting enter, and receiving the output from ChatGPT. But let’s take this one step further.

I want to spice things up, quite literally, and combine cuisines to add some excitement to the foods I should be eating. We’ll ask ChatGPT to turn these combinations into a shopping list alongside the necessary cooking instructions.

As you can see, we have a serious fusion menu. If we don’t like the suggestions, we can use the ‘regenerate response' button to get different variations.

This prompt is especially intriguing for several reasons. First, it demands a leap from the structured world of recipes to the emotive realm of poetry, especially that of Shakespearean caliber.

It's a testament to ChatGPT's multifaceted capabilities – from providing structured, practical outputs to creating artistic content that resonates on a deeply human level.

Additionally, the request doesn't end with the poem. It goes a step further, asking for a webpage design, a bridge from the world of words into the visual domain of web design.

This multi-layered prompt illustrates how we can make connections across diverse and what were once seemingly unrelated tasks – creative writing and coding – into a single query, challenging ChatGPT to produce a holistic, interconnected solution.

Such a layered prompt really showcases the spectrum of what ChatGPT can achieve. It's not just about answering questions; it's about embracing an idea, expanding upon it, and weaving it into a tapestry of interconnected outputs that serve a broader vision.

I hope this example highlights the capabilities of what prompt engineering with ChatGPT can produce. As you saw in the example, ChatGPT is not just your run-of-the-mill chatbot.

The outputs may not be perfect on the first try, it may have errors. Instead of criticizing it, think about the additional context you can provide to get an even better output on the next iteration.

That’s what ChatGPT is all about. It’s not “write me an essay on cooking.” It’s about sparring back and forth with the language model, sharing ideas, and examples, and letting it learn your style and preferences until you get the desired response.

Now that you’ve seen ChatGPT’s capabilities, let me properly introduce myself. I’m Alex. I’ve been building and scaling AI products since 2021. I also write Sunday Signal, a newsletter covering AI highlights and broader insights that intrigue and inspire. I'm excited to guide you through the world of prompt engineering. You'll discover the tools and techniques to master your interactions with ChatGPT.

16. Getting the most out of ChatGPT
03:17 - 03:43
When taking this course, I want you to think of prompt engineering as getting the most out of ChatGPT. A basic prompt leads to a basic answer. But a well-thought-out prompt with rich context leads to capabilities that are powerful beyond measure. Whether you’re summarising text, creating content in your style or even writing code — after combining ChatGPT with effective prompting, your limitations are unbounded.

17. Beyond traditional chatbots
03:43 - 04:03
Traditional chatbots work on predefined responses to specific inputs. But for ChatGPT, a chatbot that is tailored for human conversation, levering its understanding of language to discern the best response means you have access to a tool that has the potential to spark your imagination and allow your creativity to take flight.

Now it’s time to get hands-on. In the exercises, you will try prompting ChatGPT yourself. Remember, just like the example I showed, the clearer your prompt, the better the output. Head over to the exercises to test your understanding!
