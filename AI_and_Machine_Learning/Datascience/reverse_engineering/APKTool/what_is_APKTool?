**APKTool** is a powerful open-source tool used for reverse engineering Android APK (Android Package) files. It allows users to decompile APK files into their constituent resources and code, make modifications, and then recompile the APK back into its original form. APKTool is particularly useful for:

1. **Decompiling APKs**: It extracts resources such as XML layouts, images, and the AndroidManifest.xml, as well as the appâ€™s Smali code (an intermediate representation of Android bytecode).

2. **Recompiling APKs**: After modifying the decompiled files, APKTool can repackage the files back into a working APK.

3. **Localizing Applications**: Developers can use APKTool to extract strings and other resources from an app and then modify them for localization (e.g., translating an app into different languages).

4. **Debugging**: APKTool helps developers or security researchers debug small issues with applications, especially ones where they don't have the source code.

5. **Customization**: Modify the app's behavior, UI, or permissions, and repackage it for personal or security research purposes.

APKTool supports most Android versions and is commonly used by developers, security analysts, and modders.
