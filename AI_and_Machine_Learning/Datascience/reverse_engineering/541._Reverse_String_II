To solve the problem of reversing the first `k` characters for every `2k` characters in a string `s`, we can follow these steps:

1. Iterate through the string in chunks of `2k`.
2. For each chunk, reverse the first `k` characters and leave the rest as is.

Here's the Python code to achieve this:

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseStr(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        # Convert string to list for easy manipulation
        s_list = list(s)
        
        for i in range(0, len(s), 2 * k):
            # Reverse the first k characters in the current chunk
            s_list[i:i + k] = reversed(s_list[i:i + k])
        
        # Join the list back into a string and return
        return ''.join(s_list)

# Example usage:
solution = Solution()
print(solution.reverseStr("abcdefg", 2))  # Output: "bacdfeg"
print(solution.reverseStr("abcd", 2))     # Output: "bacd"
```

### Explanation:

1. **Convert String to List**: The string `s` is converted to a list `s_list` to allow in-place modifications since strings in Python are immutable.
2. **Iterate in Chunks of `2k`**: The loop iterates through the string with a step size of `2k`, ensuring each iteration processes a chunk of up to `2k` characters.
3. **Reverse the First `k` Characters**: For each chunk, the first `k` characters are reversed using Python's slicing and the `reversed` function.
4. **Join and Return**: The modified list is joined back into a string to form the final result.

This approach ensures that the string is modified according to the specified rules efficiently. The use of slicing and the `reversed` function makes the code concise and easy to understand.
