1. Rewrite the Entire Question
Problem: Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.
A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.
Example 1:
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3
Example 2:
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2
Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^4].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
2. Explain the Entire Question Step by Step
1. Input: You are given the root of a binary tree.
2. Task: Your task is to determine the maximum depth of this tree.
3. Maximum Depth: The maximum depth of a binary tree is defined as the length of the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.
4. Output: You need to return this maximum depth as an integer.
Example 1 Explanation:
Tree:
    3
   / \
  9  20
     / \
    15  7
The longest path from the root (3) to the farthest leaf node is 3 -> 20 -> 7 or 3 -> 20 -> 15, each has a length of 3.
Therefore, the maximum depth is 3.
Example 2 Explanation:
Tree:
  1
   \
    2
The longest path from the root (1) to the farthest leaf node is 1 -> 2, which has a length of 2.
Therefore, the maximum depth is 2.

    def maxDepth(self, root):
        if not root:
            return 0
        left_depth = self.maxDepth(root.left)
        right_depth = self.maxDepth(root.right)
        return max(left_depth, right_depth) + 1

class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, root):  # Define the function with root as the parameter
        if not root:  # If root is None
            return 0  # Return depth 0
        left_depth = self.maxDepth(root.left)  # Recursively find max depth of left subtree
        right_depth = self.maxDepth(root.right)  # Recursively find max depth of right subtree
        return max(left_depth, right_depth) + 1  # Return max of left and right depths plus 1 for root
