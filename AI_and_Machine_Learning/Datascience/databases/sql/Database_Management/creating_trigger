Create the 'employees' Table: Ensure to define at least one column for the table. Here's an example with an id column:
 
 
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50)
    -- Add more columns as needed
);
Create a Trigger: After the 'employees' table exists, define a trigger that fires after each insert operation on the 'employees' table. This trigger logs employee insertions into an employee_log table:
 
 
DELIMITER //
CREATE TRIGGER after_employee_insert
AFTER INSERT ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO employee_log (employee_id, action, action_time)
    VALUES (NEW.id, 'insert', NOW());
END;
//
DELIMITER ;
Verify the Trigger: After creating the trigger, check if it exists by querying the triggers:
 
 
SHOW TRIGGERS;
Drop the Trigger (Optional): If the trigger is no longer needed, you can drop it:
 
 
DROP TRIGGER after_employee_insert;
This tutorial covers creating a table, creating a trigger, verifying the trigger, and optionally dropping the trigger. Feel free to ask if you have any questions or need further assistance!
