Creating and Using a Database:
Create a new database:
 
 
CREATE DATABASE my_database;
Use the newly created database:
 
 
USE my_database;
Creating a Table:
Create a table with sensitive data:
 
 
CREATE TABLE sensitive_data (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50),
    password VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(100)
);
Authentication:
Create a user with a strong password:
 
 
CREATE USER 'my_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'my_password';
Authorization:
Grant permissions to the user:
 
 
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON my_database.sensitive_data TO 'my_user'@'localhost';
Encryption:
Encrypt sensitive columns using AES encryption:
 
 
ALTER TABLE sensitive_data MODIFY COLUMN password VARBINARY(100);
UPDATE sensitive_data SET password = AES_ENCRYPT('password123', 'encryption_key');
Best Practices:
Regularly update your database software to patch security vulnerabilities.
Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks:
 
 
PREPARE stmt FROM 'SELECT * FROM sensitive_data WHERE username = ?';
SET @user = 'username';
EXECUTE stmt USING @user;
DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt;
Limit access to sensitive data by using views:
 
 
CREATE VIEW sensitive_view AS SELECT id, username FROM sensitive_data;
Secure Connection:
Enable SSL/TLS to encrypt data in transit:
 
 
GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'my_user'@'localhost' REQUIRE SSL;
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):
Implement 2FA for user authentication:
 
 
ALTER USER 'my_user'@'localhost' REQUIRE MFA;
Database Auditing:
Enable auditing to track access and changes:
 
 
SET GLOBAL audit_log = ON;
Data Masking:
Mask sensitive data for non-privileged users:
 
 
GRANT SELECT (id, username) ON sensitive_data TO 'non_privileged_user'@'localhost';
Regular Backup and Disaster Recovery:
Implement automated backups and disaster recovery plans to ensure data availability:
 
 
BACKUP DATABASE my_database TO 'backup_location';
By following these steps and best practices, you can significantly enhance the security of your database and protect sensitive data from unauthorized access or breaches.
