 Optimize Queries with Execution Order
Knowing the SQL query execution order is essential for optimization. Queries run in this order:

FROM -> JOIN -> WHERE -> GROUP BY -> HAVING -> SELECT -> ORDER BY -> OFFSET -> LIMIT

Steps:

Make sure you apply filters (WHERE) as early as possible in your query to reduce data processing later.
Create a basic query:
 
 
SELECT category, AVG(price) AS avg_price
FROM products
WHERE category = 'Electronics'
GROUP BY category
HAVING AVG(price) > 100;
