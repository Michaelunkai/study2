Create Indexes to Speed Up Read Performance
Indexes improve search performance by creating a data structure that allows quick lookups.

Steps:

Identify columns you often use in WHERE, JOIN, or ORDER BY clauses.
Create an index on those columns:
 
 
CREATE INDEX idx_employee_name
ON employee (name);
Re-run the query with EXPLAIN ANALYZE to see the difference in performance:
 
 
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM employee WHERE name = 'John';
