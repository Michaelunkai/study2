Here are the biggest differences between PostgreSQL and SQL Server:

1. **License and Cost**: 
   - **PostgreSQL**: Open-source and free to use.
   - **SQL Server**: Proprietary software by Microsoft; requires a license for enterprise-level features.

2. **Operating System Support**: 
   - **PostgreSQL**: Cross-platform, supporting Windows, Linux, and macOS.
   - **SQL Server**: Primarily used on Windows but also available for Linux.

3. **Data Types**:
   - **PostgreSQL**: Supports a wider variety of data types, including arrays and JSON.
   - **SQL Server**: More limited in data types, with less built-in support for complex data.

4. **Community and Support**:
   - **PostgreSQL**: Has a large, active community but relies on community-driven support.
   - **SQL Server**: Backed by Microsoft with official support, making it easier for enterprise-level assistance.

5. **Replication and Clustering**:
   - **PostgreSQL**: Offers more advanced options for replication and clustering, including logical replication and native sharding.
   - **SQL Server**: Provides built-in solutions like Always On Availability Groups, but they can be complex to set up.

6. **Language Support**:
   - **PostgreSQL**: Supports multiple procedural languages like PL/pgSQL, PL/Python, and more.
   - **SQL Server**: Primarily uses T-SQL (Transact-SQL) for stored procedures.

7. **Performance**:
   - **PostgreSQL**: Known for handling complex queries and large datasets efficiently.
   - **SQL Server**: Optimized for business environments and often performs well in transactional applications.

8. **Extensibility**:
   - **PostgreSQL**: Highly extensible, allowing you to create custom data types, functions, and extensions.
   - **SQL Server**: Less extensible, with more restrictions on customizations.

9. **JSON Support**:
   - **PostgreSQL**: Offers robust JSON support with built-in functions for querying JSON data.
   - **SQL Server**: Provides JSON support but is not as mature or feature-rich as PostgreSQL.

10. **Indexing and Optimization**:
    - **PostgreSQL**: Has a variety of indexing options, including partial and expression indexes.
    - **SQL Server**: Advanced indexing options like filtered indexes, but with a different approach to query optimization.

Both databases have strengths in different areas, making the choice dependent on the specific needs of your project or organization.
