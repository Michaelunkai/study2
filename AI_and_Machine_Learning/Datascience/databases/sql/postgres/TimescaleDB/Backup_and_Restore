Backup and Restore
To backup your TimescaleDB database, use the pg_dump tool:

 
 
sudo -i -u postgres pg_dump -d my_timescale_db -F c -b -v -f my_timescale_db.backup
To restore your TimescaleDB database, use the pg_restore tool:

 
 
sudo -i -u postgres pg_restore -d my_timescale_db -v my_timescale_db.backup
By following these steps, you will have a fully functional TimescaleDB setup on your Ubuntu system, ready to handle time-series data efficiently.
