Understanding the Basics of Gradient Boosted Trees
What are Gradient Boosted Trees?

Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT) is an ensemble machine learning technique that combines the predictions from multiple decision trees to produce a final prediction. This method is used for both regression and classification problems. The primary concept behind GBT is to build models sequentially, each new model correcting the errors made by the previous models.

Key Concepts:

Ensemble Learning: Combining the predictions from multiple models to improve the overall performance.
Decision Trees: A tree-like model used to make predictions by splitting data based on feature values.
Boosting: A sequential technique where each new model is trained to correct the errors of the previous models.
How Does Gradient Boosting Work?

Initialize the Model: Start with an initial prediction, usually the mean of the target variable for regression or a constant value for classification.
Compute Residuals: Calculate the residuals (errors) between the predicted and actual values.
Fit a Decision Tree: Train a decision tree on the residuals. The tree will try to predict the errors of the initial model.
Update the Model: Add the new tree to the existing model, updating the predictions.
Repeat: Continue this process for a specified number of iterations or until the model performance stops improving.
Example: Predicting House Prices with Gradient Boosted Trees
Let's illustrate this with an example using a simple dataset to predict house prices.

Step-by-Step Example:

Import Libraries:

 
 
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
Load Dataset:

 
 
# Example dataset
data = {
    'Size': [1500, 1700, 2000, 2200, 2500],
    'Bedrooms': [3, 3, 4, 4, 5],
    'Age': [10, 5, 20, 15, 5],
    'Price': [300000, 350000, 400000, 425000, 450000]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
Prepare Data:

 
 
X = df[['Size', 'Bedrooms', 'Age']]
y = df['Price']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
Train the Model:

 
 
model = GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=3, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
Make Predictions:

 
 
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
Eva te the Model:

 
 
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')
