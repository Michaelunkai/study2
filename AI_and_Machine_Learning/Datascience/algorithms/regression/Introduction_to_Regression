 Introduction to Regression
What is Regression?
Regression is a statistical method used to understand the relationship between dependent (target) and independent (predictor) variables. It is used to predict continuous outcomes.

Types of Regression:
Linear Regression: Predicts a continuous outcome based on the linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables.
Multiple Linear Regression: Similar to linear regression but involves multiple independent variables.
Polynomial Regression: Models the relationship as an nth degree polynomial.
Logistic Regression: Used for binary classification problems, predicting probabilities.
Key Concepts in Regression:
Dependent Variable: The outcome you're trying to predict.
Independent Variable: The predictor or feature used to make predictions.
Coefficient: Represents the relationship strength and direction between variables.
Intercept: The expected mean value of the dependent variable when all predictors are zero.
R-squared (R²): A statistical measure representing the proportion of variance for a dependent variable explained by an independent variable(s).
Steps in Regression Analysis:
Understand the Data: Analyze the data to understand its structure and relationships.
Preprocess the Data: Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
Build the Model: Use the appropriate regression algorithm to build the model.
Evaluate the Model: Assess the model's performance using metrics like R², Mean Squared Error (MSE), etc.
Interpret the Results: Understand the coefficients and their implications.
