Multiple linear regression is an extension of simple linear regression. It allows us to model the relationship between one dependent variable and multiple independent variables.

**Basic Equation:**
\[ y = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + ... + b_nx_n \]


Where:
- \( y \) is the dependent variable.
- \( x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \) are the independent variables.
- \( b_0 \) is the y-intercept.
- \( b_1, b_2, ..., b_n \) are the coefficients for each independent variable.
