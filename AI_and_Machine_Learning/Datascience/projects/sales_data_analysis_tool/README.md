# Sales Data Analysis Tool

## Project Overview

The Sales Data Analysis Tool is a comprehensive Python-based application designed to analyze sales data, generate insights, and predict future sales trends. This tool is built using Python, SQLite, and Flask, and it features advanced data analysis capabilities, machine learning integration, and a polished web interface.

## Features

### 1. **Data Ingestion and Storage**
   - The tool stores sales data in an SQLite database, making it easy to manage and retrieve data.
   - Users can ingest new sales data from CSV files, which is then automatically appended to the database.

### 2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**
   - The application includes advanced data cleaning and transformation features to ensure data quality.
   - It handles missing data, detects outliers, and transforms the data for more accurate analysis.

### 3. **Data Analysis**
   - Users can perform detailed data analysis, generating basic statistics and visualizing total sales by product.
   - The tool provides insights into sales trends, helping businesses make informed decisions.

### 4. **Machine Learning for Predictive Analysis**
   - The tool integrates a machine learning model (Linear Regression) to predict future sales based on historical data.
   - Predictions are saved in the database and can be visualized to understand sales trends.

### 5. **Professional Web Interface**
   - The tool features a polished web interface built with Flask and Bootstrap, providing a professional look and feel.
   - Users can interact with the tool through a web browser, accessing data analysis and predictions easily.
