What is Data Science?
Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It combines various aspects of statistics, data analysis, machine learning, and domain knowledge.

Key Components of Data Science:

Data Collection: Gathering data from various sources.
Data Cleaning: Preparing and cleaning data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the main characteristics of the data.
Data Modeling: Applying statistical and machine learning models to make predictions or decisions.
Data Visualization: Representing data in visual formats to communicate findings effectively.
Deployment: Implementing data science models in real-world applications.
