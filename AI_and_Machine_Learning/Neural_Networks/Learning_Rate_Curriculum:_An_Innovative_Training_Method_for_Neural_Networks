## Learning Rate Curriculum: An Innovative Training Method for Neural Networks

### Introduction
Recent studies predominantly focus on language models. To diversify the exploration of training methodologies, this article examines an innovative approach called the Learning Rate Curriculum (LRC). The concept draws parallels with how students are taughtâ€”progressing from simpler to more complex material.

### Variations of Curriculum Learning
There are several variations of curriculum learning:

1. **Gradual Difficulty Increase:** Training begins with easy examples, gradually introducing more complex ones.
2. **Task Complexity Increase:** Starting with simpler tasks and incrementally increasing their complexity.
3. **Model Complexity Increase:** Training initially with a simpler model and gradually increasing its complexity.

### The Concept of Learning Rate Curriculum
The LRC approach focuses on the learning rate during training. The authors suggest that in convolutional networks, it is beneficial to initially emphasize learning in the early layers. Poorly trained early layers can produce noisy data, complicating the learning process in subsequent layers. Similar phenomena are observed when fine-tuning a pre-trained model for a new task.

### Proposed Methodology
To address these issues, the authors propose starting with a high learning rate for the initial layers, which decreases progressively for deeper layers. Over iterations, the learning rates across all layers are gradually increased until they converge. This convergence should occur in significantly fewer iterations than the total required for model training, effectively applying this method during the "warm-up" phase of training.

### Conclusion
The Learning Rate Curriculum offers a novel approach to training neural networks, potentially enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the training process. For further details, refer to the original study: [Learning Rate Curriculum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09180).
