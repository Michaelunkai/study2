Training the Neural Network
To train the neural network, you need a dataset. For demonstration, let's create some dummy data.

Add the following code to neural_network.py:


import numpy as np

# Create dummy data
X_train = np.array([[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1]])
y_train = np.array([0, 1, 1, 0])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100)

# Evaluate the model
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_train, y_train)
print(f'Loss: {loss}, Accuracy: {accuracy}')


Explanation
Dummy Data: We create a simple dataset for XOR problem.
Training: The fit method is used to train the model for 100 epochs.
Evaluation: The evaluate method is used to compute the loss and accuracy of the model on the training data.
