Making Predictions
Now it is time to used our saved model to make predictions. Now this is a little bit harder than it looks because we need to consider the following: – our model accepts integer encoded data – our model needs reviews that are of length 250 words

This means we can’t just pass any string of text into our model. It will need to be reshaped and reformed to meet the criteria above.
