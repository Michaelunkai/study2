Saving the Model
Up until this point we have simply been retraining our models every time that we wanted to use them. This is fine for now on our small models that take only a few seconds to train but for larger models this is not realistic. Luckily for us keras provides a very easy way to save our models:

model.save("model.h5")  # name it whatever you want but end with .h5
