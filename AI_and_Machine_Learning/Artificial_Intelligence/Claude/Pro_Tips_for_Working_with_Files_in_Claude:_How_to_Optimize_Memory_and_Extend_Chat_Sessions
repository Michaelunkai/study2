# Pro Tips for Working with Files in Claude: How to Optimize Memory and Extend Chat Sessions

If you work with files 📁 in **Claude**, stay tuned because I'm about to give you a professional tip that will change the way you work.

I receive numerous private messages asking, *“Why does Claude get blocked so quickly when I upload multiple files?”*

Sound familiar?

The surprising part is that this happens even in the paid version!

So, to work with **Claude** like a pro, you need to understand why this happens. Every time you interact with a language model, before it gives you an answer, it *goes over the entire conversation, including all the files and content you’ve uploaded!* This means it re-reads all the documents every time, which quickly fills up its memory, leading to it getting blocked.

*So, what's the solution?*

Here’s the fix: 💡

1. Upload your files and extract all the essential information from them.
2. Copy this extracted information and open a new chat—then use that chat to ask questions, delve deeper, and continue your conversation.

*As simple as it sounds, it’s incredibly effective!* 🧠

What’s the benefit? When you dive deeper into the conversation, you’re not *wasting* the chat’s memory, and on average, you can continue the conversation up to **6 times longer**! ⏱️

So, what are you waiting for? Try it out and let me know how it works for you.
