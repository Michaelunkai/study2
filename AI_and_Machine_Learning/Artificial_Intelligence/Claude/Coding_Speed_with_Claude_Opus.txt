Accelerate Your Coding Speed by 10x with Claude Opus
Since the release of ChatGPT, my approach to coding and overall productivity has transformed remarkably. Today, I spend more time crafting prompts than writing actual lines of code, and my daily progress has increased exponentially. For anyone not leveraging these tools, the efficiency gap is significant, and they risk falling behind.
My Background and Tools
I’m a full stack developer working primarily with React and Flask. Here are the AI tools that have revolutionized my workflow:
Claude Opus
Claude Opus, particularly its chat interface, has become my go-to tool. Occasionally, I use the API when I hit the daily limit. For my coding style, Claude Opus consistently outperforms ChatGPT, delivering significantly better results.
GitHub Copilot
While Claude Opus handles 98% of my code generation and debugging, I still use GitHub Copilot for autocompletions. It’s particularly useful for making minor changes within a file, where using Claude Opus would be overkill.
VSCode and AI Code Editors
I avoid hyped-up VSCode extensions or AI code editors that generate code directly in the file. When prompting an LLM, getting the exact desired output often requires multiple attempts. Having a complete chat interface with message history, like those provided by ChatGPT and Claude, is invaluable for this iterative process. I’ve tested various AI coding extensions and always return to the separate chat interfaces for their superior utility.
Mastering Prompt Engineering
Effective prompt engineering is crucial for maximizing the output from LLMs. Vague instructions yield vague results. The most efficient way to get the code you need is to provide a clear example, such as a React component in the desired style or format.
Here are some prompts I frequently use:
- Respond with code only in CODE SNIPPET format, no explanations
- Just provide the parts that need to be modified
- Provide entire updated component
These prompts help streamline the responses, eliminating unnecessary explanations and speeding up the generation process.
Enhancing Efficiency with Shortcuts
I’ve saved my most-used prompts in a custom Chrome extension, enabling me to insert them with keyboard shortcuts. Additionally, I’ve added custom shortcuts to the Claude interface for tasks like creating new chats. These small adjustments accumulate over time, significantly boosting daily productivity.
Conclusion
These strategies have drastically improved my coding efficiency. By using tools like Claude Opus and GitHub Copilot and mastering prompt engineering, you can achieve similar gains. I’m eager to hear how others are enhancing their coding workflows with LLMs.
