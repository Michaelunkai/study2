Interact via API:
You can also interact with your Rasa bot programmatically through HTTP API calls. Hereâ€™s how you might send a message to your bot:

 
 
curl -XPOST http://localhost:5005/webhooks/rest/webhook -d '{"sender": "test_user", "message": "hello"}'
This will send a message to your bot and you'll receive the bot's response as a JSON.
