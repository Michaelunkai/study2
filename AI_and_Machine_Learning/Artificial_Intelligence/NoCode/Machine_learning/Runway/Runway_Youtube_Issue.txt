ðŸ›‘ Runway Gets into Trouble with YouTube! ðŸ›‘
You won't believe what I'm about to tell you!
**Runway Gen-3**, the amazing video generator we all knew and loved, is at the center of a massive storm!
**It turns out that Runway used thousands of YouTube videos to train its algorithm without any permission!** Yes, you read that right!
Leading content creators like The New Yorker, VICE News, Pixar, Disney, and Netflix found out that their videos were used to train the AI without their knowledge.
The most troubling part is how Runway did it. They used open-source software and proxies to collect the videos and bypass YouTube's restrictions. It's like breaking into someone's house and taking their property without asking!
**The implication:** We are facing a tough moral question. Is it right to use copyrighted materials to train generative AI models? Is it ethical?
Could we see massive lawsuits and legal battles over copyright between tech companies and content creators in the near future?
