Google Makes Its Gemini Chatbot Faster and More Widely Available
In an effort to keep pace with competitors in the generative AI field such as Anthropic and OpenAI, Google is releasing updates to the free tier of Gemini. These updates focus on making the platform more efficient and widely available.
Gemini 1.5 Flash Update
- Starting Thursday, Gemini 1.5 Flash, a lightweight multimodal model announced in May, will be available on the web and mobile in 40 languages and approximately 230 countries.
- Gemini 1.5 Flash offers improvements in quality and response time, particularly in image understanding.
- The model was presented as a "distilled" and highly efficient version of Gemini 1.5 Pro.
Context Window Expansion
- Google is expanding Gemini's context window to 32,000 tokens, equivalent to about 24,000 words (or 48 pages of text).
- The context window refers to the input data the model considers before generating output.
Additional Improvements
- Google will allow file uploads from Google Drive and local devices for all Gemini users, which previously required the paid Gemini Advanced.
- Capability to analyze data files and create insights with charts and graphics.
- A new feature will display web content links below certain answers generated by Gemini, as part of efforts to combat 'hallucinations'.
Availability and New Languages
- Google is expanding Gemini's use in Messages in the European Economic Area (EEA), the UK, and Switzerland, with support for additional languages such as French, Polish, and Spanish.
- Users can activate Gemini in Messages by tapping the "start chat" button and selecting Gemini as the chat partner.
