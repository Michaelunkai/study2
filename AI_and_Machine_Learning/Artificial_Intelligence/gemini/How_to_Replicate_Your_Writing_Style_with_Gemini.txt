游눠 How to Accurately Replicate Your Writing Style with Gemini 九꽲잺
游논 1. Gather Your Documents
Create a Google Docs document with examples of your texts. Ensure these texts are of the same type (articles, newsletters, social media posts, etc.).
游논 2. Insert the Prompt
Switch to Gemini Advanced and use this prompt template:
"Act as a professional copywriter. Find my doc '[GDOCS NAME]' in my Drive. It contains X examples of [DESCRIPTION]. Analyze the writing style, redundant elements, introductions, conclusions, and structure of the [DOCUMENT TYPE] examples in this document. Then write a new [DOCUMENT TYPE] with exactly the same writing style, structure, and elements about [TOPIC]".
(This works in regular Gemini too, but Gemini Advance produces much better results)
*Note: Ensure the Google Workspace extension is enabled so that Gemini can find your document.
游논 3. Add Specific Elements If Necessary
If you want to add specific elements to your text, use this prompt:
"Keep the same analysis, structure, writing style, introduction, conclusion, etc. but replace the information in the [DOCUMENT TYPE] with this one: INFORMATION BEGINNING [PASTE YOUR ELEMENTS] INFORMATION END"
游논 4. Use Gemini's Features
Gemini has many features you can use to get better results:
- You can choose from different drafts and pick the one that best suits your needs
- You can also modify the response with a simple click
