# LLaMA-3.1 with One Trillion Parameters: Download and Setup Guide
## Introduction
The largest and possibly the most powerful model on Huggingface is now available for download: LLaMA-3.1 with one trillion parameters. The model is an extension of LLaMA-3.1-405B (layer duplication).
Available for download here: [LLaMA-3.1-1T-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/mlabonne/BigLlama-3.1-1T-Instruct)
## Setup Instructions
### Step 1: Hardware Purchase
To run the model, you need to purchase at least four DGX-H100 servers at a total cost of approximately $1,540,000. It is recommended to check the exact price based on the time of day.
### Step 2: Installation and Cable Deployment
After purchasing the equipment, install the computers and lay out the communication cables between the machines in an acoustically isolated server room, as the noise from these machines is very loud.
### Step 3: Install Required Libraries
Install the necessary libraries in Python:
```bash
pip install transformers torch
```
### Step 4: Load the Model and Tokenizer
Load the model and tokenizer:
```python
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained('mlabonne/BigLlama-3.1-1T-Instruct')
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('mlabonne/BigLlama-3.1-1T-Instruct')
```
### Step 5: Encode and Run the Model
Encode the chat input and run the model:
```python
encoded_text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template([{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, is scale all you need?"}])
generated_text = model.generate(encoded_text)
```
Good luck!
