### Step-by-Step Tutorial: Building a Custom GPT with API Requests

This tutorial will guide you through creating a custom GPT that can make API requests using data from a Google Spreadsheet. By the end, you will have a GPT that can query a database and return relevant information based on user queries.

### Step 1: Create Your Spreadsheet Database

1. **Open Google Sheets** and create a new spreadsheet.
2. **Add the following columns** to your spreadsheet:
   - **Column A:** Name
   - **Column B:** Biography
   - **Column C:** Industry
3. **Populate the spreadsheet** with sample data that represents community members, their biographies, and their industries.

### Step 2: Convert Spreadsheet to an API with Sheety

1. **Go to [Sheety](https://sheety.co/)** and log in or sign up.
2. **Create a new project** and link it to your Google Spreadsheet.
3. **Use the following prompt in Sheety** to create your API:

    plaintext
   Create an API endpoint from the following Google Spreadsheet:

   1. The spreadsheet contains the following columns: Name, Biography, Industry.
   2. I want to use the GET method to retrieve data based on specific queries.
   3. The endpoint should allow filtering based on any of the columns (e.g., find a person by their name, industry, or keywords in their biography).
   4. The API should return a JSON response with the following structure:

   {
     "id": "<row_id>",
     "name": "<Name>",
     "biography": "<Biography>",
     "industry": "<Industry>"
   }

   5. Ensure the API URL is simple and clear.
   6. Provide me with the JavaScript code snippet to make GET requests to this API.
   7. Ensure that the API is live and accessible.

   Once the API is set up, I will use it in a custom GPT for querying the database.

4. **Sheety will provide you with a formula** for filtering data based on queries. You can use the following formula in your Google Sheet:

    plaintext
   =FILTER(A2:C1000, (A2:A1000=Name)*(B2:B1000=Biography)*(C2:C1000=Industry))

   - This formula assumes that your data is in cells **A2:C1000** and that specific queries are in separate cells named **Name**, **Biography**, and **Industry**.

### Step 3: Create an OpenAPI Schema

1. **Use ChatGPT** to generate an OpenAPI schema based on the API you created.
2. Provide the JavaScript code snippet and the response structure to ChatGPT, asking it to generate an OpenAPI schema.
3. **Example Schema Prompt**:

    plaintext
   You are given a JavaScript code snippet that makes a GET request to an API endpoint. Here is the structure of the response:

   {
     "id": "<row_id>",
     "name": "<Name>",
     "biography": "<Biography>",
     "industry": "<Industry>"
   }

   Create an OpenAPI schema for this API.

4. **Review and adjust the schema** if needed, using ChatGPT to correct any errors.

### Step 4: Build Your Custom GPT in GPT Builder

1. **Go to GPT Builder** and create a new GPT.
2. **Configure the GPT**:
   - **Name**: Give your GPT a relevant name.
   - **Description**: Describe the GPT’s function.
3. **Paste the OpenAPI schema** you generated into the "Actions" section of the GPT configuration.
4. Ensure that the schema is correctly formatted and includes a sample URL if needed.

### Step 5: Define the GPT’s Role and Prompts

1. **Use GPT Builder** to define the role and goal of your GPT. For example:

   - **Role**: Act as a community member for a technology-focused founder community.
   - **Goal**: Facilitate network and collaboration by connecting members based on their expertise and needs.

2. **Create prompts** for handling queries, guidelines, and communication style. For example:

   - **Query Handling**: Define how the GPT should interpret and respond to queries.
   - **Guidelines**: Set rules for prioritizing responses and handling ambiguity.
   - **Communication Style**: Specify how the GPT should communicate with users.

### Step 6: Test Your GPT

1. **Test the GPT** by asking it queries such as, “Find me someone who understands artificial intelligence.”
2. **Verify the responses** to ensure that the GPT is querying the API correctly and returning accurate information from your database.

### Step 7: Iterate and Improve

1. **Test different scenarios** and refine the prompts, schema, or database as necessary.
2. **Update the GPT** to improve accuracy and functionality based on user feedback.

By following these steps, you’ll have a fully functional GPT that can make API requests to a custom database, offering personalized responses based on user queries. This setup allows for dynamic interaction, making your GPT a powerful tool for community engagement or other applications.
