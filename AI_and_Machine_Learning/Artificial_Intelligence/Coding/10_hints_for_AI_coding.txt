10 Hints for AI Coding
I stopped writing code entirely in 2024.
I only copy-paste code generated by AI ‚úåÔ∏èü§ì Here are my 10 hints (based on real AI coding experience).
Hint 1: Use Chain of Thoughts for Creative Tasks
If you have a creative task such as code architecture, add "Think step-by-step" to your prompt. This will provide a detailed analysis of the problem.
Hint 2: Create a Project in Claude or Custom GPT
Add a basic explanation of your code base, including dependencies, deployment, and file structure, to a Project in Claude or a custom GPT. This saves time and makes AI's replies more precise.
Hint 3: Update AI with Latest Documentation
If AI is not aware of the latest version of your framework or plugin, copy-paste the entire documentation file and ask to generate code according to the latest specifications.
Hint 4: One Task per Session
Do not pollute the context with previous code generations and discussions. Once a problem is solved, initiate a new session. This improves quality and allows you to use "give full code" without needing to edit the code.
Hint 5: Use Clear and Specific Prompts
The more precise and detailed your request, the better the AI can understand and generate the code you need. Include details about the desired functionality: input/output type, error handling, UI behavior, etc.
Hint 6: Break Complex Tasks into Smaller Components
Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable pieces. This approach keeps your code organized and easier to manage.
Hint 7: Ask for Detailed Comments
Ask AI to include detailed comments explaining the logic of the generated code. This helps in understanding the code better and makes future modifications easier.
Hint 8: Give AI Code Review Prompts
After generating code, ask the AI to review it for potential improvements. This refines the code quality. A simple "r u sure?" can prompt AI to check its work.
Hint 9: Get Documentation
Ask AI to create documentation for your code, such as README files, API docs, and user guides. This makes it easier to manage your project later on.
Hint 10: Use AI for Database Queries and Schemas
Let AI generate database queries and schemas. It is effective at composing things like DB schemas, SQL queries, and regexes.
Hint 11: Understand the Code You Paste
You are responsible for your app, not the AI. Make sure to understand the code AI generates. Read the docs or ask AI for explanations if needed.
