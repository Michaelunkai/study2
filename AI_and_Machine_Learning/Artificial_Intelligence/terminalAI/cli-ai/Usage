Usage
After installation, you can use the CLI AI Assistant by typing s followed by your natural language command. Here are some examples:

Basic usage:

s list all files in the current directory
This will translate to: ls -la

Complex commands:

s find all python files modified in the last 7 days
This might translate to: find . -name "*.py" -mtime -7

System information:

s show system memory usage
This could translate to: free -h

Package management:

s update all installed packages
On Ubuntu/Debian, this might translate to: sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

Help command:

s help
This will display the help message.

Config command:

s config-set AI_ASSISTANT_SKIP_CONFIRM=true
This will update the configuration with the specified key-value pair.

Default Configuration
AI_ASSISTANT_SKIP_CONFIRM: Default to true. If set to false, the assistant will ask for confirmation before executing commands.
AI_DIRECTORY_TREE_CONTEXT: Default to true. If set to true, the assistant will provide directory tree as a context for AI command generation. NOTE: Disable this if you don't want to share your directory structure with the AI provider.
Edge Cases and Notes:
If the AI doesn't understand your request, it will try to provide the closest matching command or ask for clarification.
Keep requests focused on a single task for optimal results.
Remember that the generated commands are executed in your current shell environment. Be cautious with commands that might affect your system globally.
By default, the assistant will regularly wait for your interaction before executing commands.
