How to Achieve 99% Consistency with Characters in DALL-E 3
Your Key to Mastering Character Consistency
Character consistency in AI-generated illustrations is no small challenge – especially for illustrations in novels, comics, and more. It’s the art of maintaining characters that look consistent from scene to scene. It may sound simple, but it’s a bit more complex.
With DALL-E 3, even tiny changes can lead to huge differences in the image. The challenge is even greater when dealing with images of real people.
Achieving character consistency at an impressive level of 99% is only possible within a single image. Then, magic happens with smart cropping and focusing. The application is not complicated; the exercise is to phrase the prompts correctly.
Example Prompt:
"Photo montage of a middle-aged man with short hair. Top-left shows him laughing in casual attire. Top-right portrays him reading a book in glasses and a sweater. Bottom-left captures him jogging in sportswear with determination. Bottom-right depicts him playing guitar in a relaxed environment."
DALL-E 3
Notice? It’s a single image! Not four as in DALL-E 3's default.
Prompt Template:
[medium] [layout] [Top-left description] [Top-right description] [Bottom-left description] [Bottom-right description].
Medium: Think of photo, watercolor, cartoon...
Layout: By using suitable words, you can get DALL-E 3 to create a collage of multiple images. The word used above is montage, but other words like:
- Grid
- Arrangement
- Collage
- Quad-diptych
- Storyboard
- Panorama
- Split-screen
- Mosaic
- Film strip
- Comic strip
- And so on…
Description: This is the canvas on which the visual story is painted.
More Examples:
Prompt:
"Photo grid of a young woman with curly hair. Top-left captures her painting in an apron. Top-right shows her dancing in a red dress. Bottom-left illustrates her cooking in a chef’s hat. Bottom-right presents her cycling in sportswear."
DALL-E 3
Prompt:
"Photo montage of an elderly gentleman with a beard. Top-left showcases him playing chess in a suit. Top-right has him gardening in overalls. Bottom-left captures him fishing in a hat and vest. Bottom-right shows him playing the piano in a cozy room."

Before we get too excited, a reminder: DALL-E 3 isn’t perfect – yet. Some images might contain a disjointed hand, while others might have an exaggerated number of images in the collage.
Now, let’s talk about mediums. Though the examples above showed the photo medium, DALL-E 3 isn’t 'biased'. Replace the word 'photo' in our handy template, for example:
Prompt:
"Cartoon mosaic of a middle-aged man with short hair. Top-left shows him laughing in casual attire. Top-right portrays him reading a book in glasses and a sweater. Bottom-left captures him jogging in sportswear with determination. Bottom-right depicts him playing guitar in a relaxed environment."
DALL-E 3
Prompt:
"Comic strip of a young woman with curly hair. Top-left, she’s in professional attire at the office, top-right, she’s dressed for a glamorous night out, bottom-left, she’s in casual loungewear at home, and bottom-right, she’s in comfy pajamas ready for bed."
DALL-E 3
Prompt:
"Storyboard depicting a woman’s adventures in travel: top-left, she’s exploring ancient ruins, top-right, she’s riding a gondola in Venice, bottom-left, she’s hiking in a lush forest, and bottom-right, she’s on a safari observing wildlife."

Quick and Useful Tips for Working with DALL-E 3:
- Aspect Ratios: We created the images in square format due to DALL-E 3 and character consistency… but try other ratios, though be warned – the error rate might slightly increase.
- Stability Issues: If DALL-E 3 behaves a bit stubbornly, persist. Sometimes, it behaves best when only one image is requested.
- Troublesome Prompt Fixes: Use this prompt in the custom instructions: "Always generate only one image in DALL-E 3". You can also use the wisdom from Twitter users: add "DM@" at the beginning.
Summary:
The key to success with DALL-E 3 is crafting smart prompts that help maintain your character consistency. Play with formats like photo montage or comic strips, clearly define the medium and layout, and describe each image in sequence. Even with the best prompts, DALL-E 3 isn’t perfect, so persist. Sometimes you’ll need to try a few versions before getting the perfect result.
