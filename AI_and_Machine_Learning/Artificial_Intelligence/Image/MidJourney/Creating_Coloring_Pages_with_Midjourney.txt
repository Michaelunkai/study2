# How to Create Coloring Pages with Midjourney ‚Äì Step-by-Step Guide
Coloring books are a beloved activity for both children and adults, offering a creative and relaxing way to express ourselves through art.
With the latest version of Midjourney, the world of coloring books has been upgraded to a whole new level. In this post, I'll provide various Midjourney prompts tailored specifically for unique and amazing coloring books!
## üé® Coloring Page Prompts
## üìå Tips
Let's start with some tips for creating coloring pages using AI art generators like Midjourney:
### Include Keywords
To make it easier to remove the background from any image, you can type one of these keywords combined with your prompt:
- Coloring book
- Coloring page
- More specific: Coloring page for [ your audience]
Adding words like "Clean outlines," "minimal," or "line art" also helps. You can also specify "thicker line" for images with wide coloring margins.
### Use Negative Prompts "‚Äî no" to Remove Unwanted Elements
In some cases, we may need to request "negatively" to avoid colors or unnecessary elements, which can be achieved by writing "‚Äî no <unwanted element>" in the prompt.
- ‚Äî no colors
- ‚Äî no shadows
- ‚Äî no shades
This parameter can be added to prompts to remove unwanted elements. Adding the parameter ‚Äî no is similar to saying "except" at the end of a sentence.
If you need more than one element removed, use "," to separate them:
- ‚Äî no colors, shadows, shades
After this introduction, let's start our coloring journey!

## Creating a Consistent Style with Midjourney
If you want to create a coloring book, you'll want a consistent style for the whole book. You can achieve this with the "‚Äîseed" parameter.
### What is a Seed Number?
The Midjourney bot uses a Seed number to create a field of visual noise, as a starting point for creating initial images.
You can specify the same Seed number to produce similar final images each time.
### How to Access the Seed Number of an Existing Work?
1. When you are satisfied with your creation, click the response button.
2. Back up the work with an envelope emoji ‚úâÔ∏è.
3. You will receive a direct message with the Seed number.
### How to Apply Seed Numbers to Your Work
Then, simply add ‚Äìseed <value> to the end of your prompt as shown below:
If you're not sure where to start, here's a simple structure you can follow:
Coloring Page for [ your audience ], [ category/subject ] ‚Äî no color
As always, it will take trial and error to create excellent results that stand out. Good luck and happy creating!
