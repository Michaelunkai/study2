MidJourney V6.1: Incremental Improvements with No Major Surprises
This evening, MidJourney releases version 6.1, slightly enhancing the world’s best image generator. However, don’t expect groundbreaking innovations. Here are the main changes:
Key Changes in MidJourney V6.1
1. Enhanced Coherency
Significant improvements in representing arms, legs, hands, bodies, plants, and animals.
2. Improved Image Quality
Reduction in flaws and hallucinations, improved textures, and better skin quality in human images.
3. Increased Detail Accuracy
Better representation of small details, including eyes, small faces, and proportionate hands.
4. Upscalers Enhancements
Improved image and texture quality in the built-in upscalers.
5. Faster Image Processing
25% increase in image processing speed.
6. Improved Text Generation Accuracy
Continued enhancements in text generation, although still limited to English.
7. Return of the "Quality" Parameter (--q2)
This parameter, useful in version 4, returns. It increases texture accuracy at the cost of some coherency and takes 25% more time to process.
Summary
You'll get "better" or "prettier" images, but that's about it.
Important Notes
- Version V6.1 is now the default model for all MidJourney users. However, some features like Inpainting (Vary region) or Outpainting (Zoom) are still inactive in V6.1, reverting to V6.0 when used.
- Users can revert to V6 through the settings interface (/settings) or by adding the parameter "--v 6" at the end of their prompt.
Personal Opinion
This is indeed a new, upgraded model, but there are no drastic innovations. Features like 3D element generation, ControlNet-like simulations, or video capabilities, which are already available on competing platforms like Stable, Leonardo, and Artflow, are still missing. Nonetheless, these improvements are welcome.
The Real Reason for the Release
The primary goal is to collect data for the upcoming V6.2 release expected in about a month. Overall, this release is nice but not revolutionary.
