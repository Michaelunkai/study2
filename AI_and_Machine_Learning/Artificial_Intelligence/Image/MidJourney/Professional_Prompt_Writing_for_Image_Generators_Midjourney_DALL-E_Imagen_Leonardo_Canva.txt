Professional Prompt Writing for Image Generators
Three Tips for Writing Professional Prompts to Generate the Perfect Image
1. Detailed Descriptive Instruction
2. Instruction with References
3. Creating an Image from Different Elements
How to Work with Image Generators
Writing rich instructions allows us to easily direct a professional image.
Image generators such as Midjourney, DALL-E, Imagen, Leonardo, or Canva rely on every word of text we type. Therefore, the quality and level of detail in our writing have a significant impact on the final output we receive.
Why It Matters
Writing professional prompts serves as a communication bridge between us and artificial intelligence. Without detailed or clear instructions, AI may not produce results that match our expectations. The prompt is essentially the 'brief' we provide to AI to ensure it understands what we envision.
For example, assume you are a project manager, and Midjourney is a designer on your team. To get the desired result, you need to give your designer clear instructions regarding the look, feel, and desired elements of the design. Similarly, your AI prompt should cover all these details to ensure it understands and produces exactly what you want.
How It Affects the Resulting Image
If your prompt is vague or lacks details, the AI may produce an image that does not fully meet your expectations. Conversely, a well-written, detailed prompt can guide the AI to create a stunning image that exceeds your imagination.
It doesn't matter whether you work with Midjourney, DALL-E, Imagen, Canva, or Leonardo; what you write in the prompt matters.
