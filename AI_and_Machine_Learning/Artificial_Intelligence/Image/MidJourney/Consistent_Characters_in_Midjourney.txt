**How to Create Consistent Characters in Midjourney**
If you have ever created images using AI, you probably know how difficult it is to create two or more images with the same face and character. The Midjourney app has released a new feature that solves this problem.
### How to Register for Midjourney:
- Sign up for Midjourney and Discord on their website.
- After registering, go to the Discord website.
- Click on "Direct Messages" in the top left corner.
- Click on "Midjourney Bot."
### How to Create an Image:
- Type "/imagine" followed by your prompt.
- Press Enter to create the image.
### How to Use the New Feature:
- After creating an image of a person you like, click on the image.
- Click on "Open in Browser" in the bottom left corner of the image.
- Write a prompt in Discord for the new image you want to create and add `--cref URL` (of the image you opened in the browser) at the end of the prompt.
- For example, your new prompt could look like this: `photo of a woman riding a horse --cref https://â€¦ /imagine`.
### And that's it:
With this simple addition to the end of your prompts, you can now create consistent characters in all your images.
