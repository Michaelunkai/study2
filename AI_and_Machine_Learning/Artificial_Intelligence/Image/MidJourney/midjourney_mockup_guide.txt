I came across a guide by Salma (@Salmaaboukarr) on Twitter (now X). I loved what she did and thought to share her work method. Thank you, Salma, for sharing!
**Guide for Using Midjourney to Create Mockups:**
### Step 1: Describe
- Use the "/describe" function.
- Upload your raw product image.
- Upload the desired background image.
### Step 2: Cref
- Copy the image description prompt from your product.
- Repeat the process for your background image.
- Add the suffix –cref at the end.
### Step 3: Combining Product and Background
- Use the following prompt formula:
```
(IMG description prompt product) + (IMG description prompt background image) + (IMG URL product) + (IMG URL of background) (–cref)
```
The prompt used by Salma:
```
A flat rock with wildflowers growing on it, with a brown background and purple, white and blue flowers. The photograph has a style similar to commercial photography, with studio lighting creating warm tones, like a product display. There is a stone podium with pebbles around the base, captured in high resolution as a closeup shot. Blue colour tube of facial cream or body lotion on white background vector illustration, no text, white and blue colours, high resolution, professional photograph, Super resolution preserves every detail in the scene with sharpness and texture, isolated on a blank white background for easy cutout and composition, white background, highly detailed, hyperrealistic –cref https://s.mj.run/FchGf0Ry3MQ https://s.mj.run/yHOQstHlQGQ
```
### Insights and Conclusions from the Process
This method demonstrates that using the “describe” function in Midjourney to analyze images and create prompts allows for the creation of unique and stunning mockups. It is not only an efficient working method but also a creative way to see how technological tools can serve as building blocks for boundless creativity.
