Five Free Ways to Use the Flux.1 AI Image Generator
You’ve probably heard about the new FLUX model that generates images of the highest quality and level, arguably rivaling Midjourney (depending on who you ask). You can download it and run it locally on your computer, or use the API to create images. However, these methods require some technical knowledge and may not be the best option for everyone to try out Flux.1.
Here are five websites that provide free access to Flux.1:
1. Replicate
Replicate is a cloud-based platform that allows users to run and fine-tune machine learning models, including open-source and custom models. To use Flux.1, visit the Blackforest Lab page on Replicate, where you’ll see three Flux models. Only the Schnell model is accessible for free. Then, describe the image you want to create.
2. Flux AI Image Generator
Another site to try Flux.1 is fluxaiimagegenerator.com. Although it’s not an official site, you can easily generate images using Flux from there. The tool offers a free plan that includes 150 credits per month (10 credits per day).
3. Fal AI
Fal.ai is a media creation platform that provides AI inference APIs for applications. You can choose the Schnell model, while other models require payment. The larger Dev model is available for $0.025 per megapixel.
4. Hugging Face
Hugging Face is an open-source platform that allows users to create, train, and deploy machine learning models and natural language processing (NLP). To try Flux.1, create an account and access the space dedicated to the Flux.1 Schnell model.
5. BasedLabs
BasedLabs is a creative platform for generating AI-driven images and videos. Upon signing up, you’ll receive 15 free credits. Each image generation costs 1-5 credits. BasedLabs offers two paid subscription plans but allows limited free use.
I hope you find this list helpful, and if you know of other platforms that offer free access to Flux.1, please share in the comments!
Happy creating!
