**Introduction**
In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has become an important tool in teaching and learning. These tools enable the creation of diverse and engaging content, including songs that accompany the lesson and enhance the learning experience. This article will review the use of a language model to write a song and the possibility of composing it using a music generator. We will examine how teachers can integrate these tools to plan dynamic lessons, demonstrated through a song about the properties of a parallelogram.
**Creating a Song Using a Language Model**
Using language models to write songs is an innovative way to captivate students with study topics. The model can create rhyming texts with accurate information, adding interest to the material being learned. An example of this is a song 'written' about the properties of a parallelogram:
- A parallelogram is a quadrilateral,
- Two sides parallel and equal in length,
- Angles opposite each other are equal.
- Diagonals intersect, meeting at the center.
**Composing a Song Using a Music Generator**
After writing the lyrics, the song can be composed using a music generator, an AI tool that produces matching melodies. The teacher can choose the melody, style, and rhythm to accompany the words. The composition process enhances the song and gives it a musical character that helps students remember it.
**Integration in the Lesson: Implementation Methods**
There are several ways to integrate a song in the lesson using AI tools:
- Teacher as writer and composer: The teacher writes and composes the song and presents it to the students as a tool to illustrate the material.
- Students as performers: Students compose the song written by the teacher using a music generator. This activity encourages creativity and involvement.
- Students as writers and composers: Students write and compose the song themselves using the music generator. A competition can be held between the best songs to increase motivation.
**Summary**
Integrating artificial intelligence in song creation is an innovative and fascinating way to enhance the learning experience. Writing songs using a language model and composing them with a music generator enriches the lesson in various ways. Whether the teacher creates the song or the students are involved in the creation process, these tools generate interest and help remember the learned material.
