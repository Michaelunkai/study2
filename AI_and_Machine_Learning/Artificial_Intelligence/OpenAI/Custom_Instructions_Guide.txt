# Title: Step-by-Step Guide: Using 'Custom Instructions' in ChatGPT Plus
## Introduction
ChatGPT Plus, offered by OpenAI, is a subscription service that allows users to interact with an AI-powered chatbot based on GPT technology. With the recent addition of Custom Instructions, ChatGPT Plus takes personalized interactions to a new level, saving users significant time and effort.
## Understanding Custom Instructions
Custom Instructions are settings designed to teach ChatGPT how to respond to requests and prompts in a way that aligns with your preferences and desired behavior. By using this feature, you can avoid starting from scratch with the basic ChatGPT interface and repeating priming every time you open a new chat window.
## Time-Saving Potential
The main advantage of Custom Instructions is the significant time they save for regular users of the service. Instead of repeatedly specifying your requirements or perspective in every interaction, you only need to input your overall instruction once. ChatGPT Plus will retain this information for as long as you desire, even when you write new prompts with requests and questions in subsequent chat sessions.
## Potential Use Cases
OpenAI has provided several examples to demonstrate the potential applications of the Custom Instructions feature. For instance, imagine a teacher preparing a lesson plan. By enabling Custom Instructions, the teacher no longer needs to repeatedly mention that they teach science to third-grade students every time they open a new chat window. ChatGPT Plus will remember this information and respond accordingly, considering this perspective throughout the conversation.
Similarly, if you are a developer who prefers coding in Python, you can save this information in the Custom Instructions settings. This way, ChatGPT will always provide coding assistance in Python when you request it, saving you the need for constant reminders.
## How to Access the Custom Instructions Feature
To access the Custom Instructions feature, follow these simple steps:
1. Access the ChatGPT interface online or use the ChatGPT app for iOS.
2. Online, click on your username in the bottom left corner of the ChatGPT interface.

## Answering Questions in Custom Instructions
Upon entering the Custom Instructions screen, you will be presented with two specific questions to guide your input.
### Question 1: What would you like ChatGPT to know about you to provide better responses?
Here, you can express your preferences, background, or any other relevant information that will help ChatGPT understand your unique context.
### Question 2: How would you like ChatGPT to respond?
Use this opportunity to explain your desired behavior or specific instructions to ensure that ChatGPT's responses meet your expectations.
## Expanding Possibilities
Although currently limited to one set of Custom Instructions at a time, the possibilities with this feature are endless. The open-ended text boxes allow for flexible input, meaning you can provide ChatGPT Plus with various perspectives, and it will respond accordingly.
## Time Savings and Enhanced Experience
By leveraging the Custom Instructions feature, regular users of ChatGPT Plus can speed up their interactions and eliminate the need for repeated instructions. With the ability to store general guidelines and preferences, ChatGPT Plus adapts to your needs, whether you are starting new chat sessions or continuing from where you left off.
## Conclusion
The Custom Instructions feature in ChatGPT Plus significantly enhances the user experience by allowing clear prompts for responses and storing your preferences for future interactions. By simplifying conversations and eliminating the need for repeated priming, this feature saves valuable time and ensures personalized responses from the chatbot.
