Golden Tip Before Starting – Draw Inspiration from Others
As with any image generator, it is advisable to draw inspiration from others' works before creating your own with Kling. Hover over a picture created by another user to copy their prompt and use it as a reference for your video. This practice helps understand effective prompts and enables creating similar videos.
Creating AI Videos with Kling
Within Kling, users can create images and AI videos. Although it resembles Luma, it does not match its quality, and certainly not that of Runway's Gen3. However, Kling remains a commendable video generator. To create AI videos, click on the AI Videos button. In the video creation screen, choose between Text to Video (creating a video based on a textual prompt) and Image to Video (animating a static image reference).
Currently, Kling supports creating 5-second videos (in the version available outside China). You can input a textual prompt and a negative prompt (at the bottom of the screen). The Creativity slider determines adherence to the textual prompt. Advanced features like high-quality video creation and generating 10-second videos will be available soon. You can also select formats like 1:1 or 16:9.
Advanced Settings in Kling
The Camera Movement panel allows controlling the video direction (horizontal, vertical, zoom, tilt, roll, pan, etc.).
Prompt Engineering in Kling
Generally, video generators benefit from short, clean, and minimalist prompts. Unlike MidJourney or Stable Diffusion, complex prompts are unnecessary. If you struggle with prompt engineering, use the tip at the guide's beginning or the following tip: At the bottom of the prompt box, Kling suggests keywords for your prompt. Clicking on a word generates a complete prompt based on it. Clicking the circle with arrows (bottom right) generates new words. This feature helps learn how to build effective prompts.
Sample Prompts
- Cute cat walking among flowers, backlit
- The camera looks down at a volcano in the middle of the city, erupting lava
- Woman with backpack looking at a river, styled in mysterious jungle, dark orange and light emerald colors, secluded environment, nature inspired imagery, National Geographic photo, Unreal Engine 5, sensitivity to the natural world
- An astronaut sunbathes on a banana-shaped lounge chair on the beach. Tropical palm trees are in the background
- Carefully pour the milk into the cup, the milk flow is smooth, and the cup is gradually filled with milky white
- The horse lowers its head to eat grass, and the wind blows its tail
- The space fighter flies through a huge sci-fi interior tunnel at high speed and out into space, where the end of the tunnel looks out into the space war
- A medieval sailboat sailing on the sea, foggy nights, bright moonlight, eerie atmosphere
Using Negative Prompts
At the bottom of the screen, you can input words you don't want in your generation in the Negative Prompt box. For instance, words like "distorted," "blurred," "low resolution," "low quality," etc. Conversely, if you want a photorealistic image, you can input "illustration" or "drawing" in the negative prompt.
Examples and User Experience
The following videos were created using Kling's Chinese version. Despite some cherry-picking, from personal and industry colleagues' experience, Kling is a good video generator but not a game-changer.

Kling's Credit System
Upon registration, you receive "Inspiration Credits" from Kling AI, the company's currency. New credits are awarded daily. Initially, you receive 66 Inspiration Credits. Some features, like watermark removal, high-quality video creation, extended video length, and advanced filming support, are premium and not supported by regular Inspiration Credits. Currently, many features are restricted in the version available outside China.
Personal Opinion
Personally, I was not overly impressed. The videos seen so far raised expectations, and now that the tool is accessible, it turns out that not all that glitters is gold. Kling is a decent video generator, producing good results and versatile, but it pales compared to alternatives like Runway's Gen3 or Luma's Dream Machine. Especially when compared to Sora! This leads me to my final point – Sora. Without a doubt, the longest teaser in history! The tool everyone is waiting for. Now, after experiencing a tool surrounded by massive hype but failing to meet expectations, I wonder if the same will happen when Sora opens its doors to the public. Despite cherry-picking, I hope it meets expectations.
Conclusion
Kling is a nice video generator, rated 6 out of 10 (with Luma and Gen3 rated 7-8). Will Sora be a 9...? Only time will tell.
