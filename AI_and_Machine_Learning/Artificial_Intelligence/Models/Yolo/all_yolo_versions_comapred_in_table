### Notes:
- **Speed (FPS):** Frames per second are approximate and can vary depending on hardware.
- **Accuracy (mAP):** Mean Average Precision is typically measured on either the COCO dataset or VOC dataset.
- **Backbone:** The core feature extraction network used in the YOLO version.
- **Innovations:** Highlights unique features or improvements introduced in each version.

This table summarizes the key aspects of each YOLO version, helping you compare their performance, accuracy, and unique features.
