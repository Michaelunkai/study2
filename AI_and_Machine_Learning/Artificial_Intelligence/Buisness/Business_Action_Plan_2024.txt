**How to Use ChatGPT to Create a Business Action Plan for 2024**
The year 2024 has begun, and it's impossible not to think about setting annual goals. Setting annual goals is particularly useful for self-employed entrepreneurs because we have no one but ourselves to rely on for guidance. It is essential to set clear goals and create clear paths to act upon.
### Introduction
#### Why Not to Set Annual Goals (And What to Do Instead)
The biggest problem with setting annual goals is that their nature works against our brain's reward center. The brain has difficulty understanding such a long timeframe and staying highly motivated towards such a distant goal. In the fast-paced world of entrepreneurship, one event can change everything and render our annual goals obsolete.
#### The Difference Between Goals and Vision
There is a distinct difference between setting goals and holding a vision. Thinking about a vision, i.e., imagining where we want to be in a year, five, or even ten years, is powerful. But for setting real, tangible milestones of success, it's better to use a shorter timeframe. According to scientific experiments, the optimal timeframe for setting goals is three months.
### 3 Strong Principles for Setting Ambitious Goals
#### Principle 1: Set Action-Oriented Goals
Focus your goals on actions that you can directly control rather than outcomes that might result from them. For example, an action-oriented goal would be "send 20 daily messages and post 5 pieces of content a week".
#### Principle 2: Set One Goal per Quarter
Having too many goals to focus on makes it less likely to achieve even one of them. Therefore, it's better to focus on setting one goal per quarter.
#### Principle 3: Set Challenging Goals Using the 4% Rule
Set goals that are just 4% beyond what you think is possible. This ensures that the goals will challenge you but won't seem too difficult to achieve.
### How to Create a Blueprint for 2024 Using the Annual Action Mapper Prompt
The following prompt will help create an annual action plan and dominate 2024:
**Prompt:**
```
I want you to act as the Annual Action Mapper, an AI specialized in turning aspirational annual visions into actionable, tangible quarterly goals, and turning these quarterly goals into an actionable business roadmap for me.
The time horizon for this exercise is 12 months, and your goal is to lay out a plan for the entirety of the year 2024.
My 1-year vision is {1. INSERT YOUR VISION}
For context, {2. INSERT YOUR CONTEXT}
Using the specifics of my vision and my context, help me reverse-engineer my goal into a 3-month actionable roadmap that I can follow to reach it.
The thinking behind this is that each yearly vision is just the sum of a few tangible outcomes, and these tangible outcomes are just the result of quarterly goals, and the quarterly goals are the sum/result of weekly action steps.
Your output should contain my annual vision, quarterly goals and weekly KPIs.
Constraints:
1) The KPIs for each week should be quantifiable
Every quarter of the 12 months of the roadmap should be formatted like this:
Quarter 1: [QUARTERLY GOAL]
Month 1: [BIG GOAL OF Month 1]
Summarize the month's goal and KPIs.
Week 1: [BIG GOAL OF WEEK 1]
Summarize and quantify weekly actions that I need to take to reach week 1's first goal (in a way that I can put it into my calendar)
Week 2: [BIG GOAL OF WEEK 2]
Summarize and quantify weekly actions that I need to take to reach week 2's first goal (in a way that I can put it into my calendar)
Week 3: [BIG GOAL OF WEEK 3]
Summarize and quantify weekly actions that I need to take to reach week 3's first goal (in a way that I can put it into my calendar)
Week 4: [BIG GOAL OF WEEK 4]
Summarize and quantify weekly actions that I need to take to reach week 2's first goal (in a way that I can put it into my calendar)
Month 2: [BIG GOAL OF Month 1]
Summarize the month's goal and KPIs.
Week 5: [BIG GOAL OF WEEK 1]
Summarize and quantify weekly actions that I need to take to reach week 1's first goal (in a way that I can put it into my calendar)
Week 6: [BIG GOAL OF WEEK 2]
Summarize and quantify weekly actions that I need to take to reach week 2's first goal (in a way that I can put it into my calendar)
Week 7: [BIG GOAL OF WEEK 3]
Summarize and quantify weekly actions that I need to take to reach week 3's first goal (in a way that I can put it into my calendar)
Week 8: [BIG GOAL OF WEEK 4]
Summarize and quantify weekly actions that I need to take to reach week 2's first goal (in a way that I can put it into my calendar)
Month 2: [BIG GOAL OF Month 1]
Summarize the month's goal and KPIs.
Week 9: [BIG GOAL OF WEEK 1]
Summarize and quantify weekly actions that I need to take to reach week 1's first goal (in a way that I can put it into my calendar)
Week 10: [BIG GOAL OF WEEK 2]
Summarize and quantify weekly actions that I need to take to reach week 2's first goal (in a way that I can put it into my calendar)
Week 11: [BIG GOAL OF WEEK 3]
Summarize and quantify weekly actions that I need to take to reach week 3's first goal (in a way that I can put it into my calendar)
Week 12: [BIG GOAL OF WEEK 4]
Summarize and quantify weekly actions that I need to take to reach week 2's first goal (in a way that I can put it into my calendar)
Quarter 2: [QUARTERLY GOAL]
Etc.
Make this very detailed and tactical.
Rules:
ALL goals need to be hyper-specific countable and tangible. That means I need to be able to count the goals, and if someone would ask: “Did you achieve [GOAL DESCRIPTION]?” I need to be able to objectively answer that question with a yes or no.
The weekly goals need to be action-oriented
The goals should roughly suit the workload of the given period. In other words, weekly goals should take 2-5 business days of hard work.
```
### How to Use the Prompt
1. Insert your annual vision into the appropriate place in the prompt.
2. Insert your context, i.e., background information about yourself, into the prompt.
3. Answer the questions that the AI will ask about your next year.
4. Use your calendar to implement the plan and create a real impact on the upcoming year.
Put the action steps in your calendar or task management software and save the action plan from ChatGPT so you can always refer back to it.
