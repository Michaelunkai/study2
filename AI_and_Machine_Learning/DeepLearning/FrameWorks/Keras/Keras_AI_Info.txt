Keras is an open-source software library that provides a Python interface for artificial neural networks. It is designed to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks and is user-friendly, modular, and extensible. Keras supports multiple backend neural network computation engines, including TensorFlow, Theano, and Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK).
Key features of Keras include:
1. User-Friendly API: Keras has a high-level API that makes it easy to build and train models with minimal lines of code.
2. Modularity: Keras models are made by connecting configurable building blocks, making it simple to create and customize complex models.
3. Extensibility: New modules can be easily added as new classes and functions.
4. Support for Multiple Backends: Keras supports multiple backend engines, allowing it to run on various hardware and software configurations.
Keras is widely used in industry and academia for tasks such as image classification, natural language processing, and time series forecasting.
