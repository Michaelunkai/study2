Here are ten popular deep learning tools widely used in research and industry:

1. **TensorFlow:** An open-source framework developed by Google for building and training deep learning models.
2. **PyTorch:** Developed by Facebook, it provides dynamic computation graphs and is popular for research and prototyping.
3. **Keras:** A high-level API running on top of TensorFlow, making it easier to build and experiment with deep learning models.
4. **Caffe:** A deep learning framework developed by Berkeley Vision and Learning Center (BVLC), known for its speed and modularity.
5. **MXNet:** A scalable deep learning framework supported by Apache, known for its efficiency and flexibility.
6. **Chainer:** A flexible framework with a focus on dynamic neural networks, developed by Preferred Networks.
7. **Theano:** An older deep learning library that paved the way for many modern frameworks; it is no longer actively maintained but influenced many others.
8. **JAX:** Developed by Google, it provides high-performance numerical computing with automatic differentiation and is increasingly used for deep learning research.
9. **Hugging Face Transformers:** A library for state-of-the-art natural language processing models, built on top of PyTorch and TensorFlow.
10. **ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange):** An open format for AI models, allowing interoperability between different deep learning frameworks.

These tools cater to various needs, from research to production, and each offers unique features and advantages.
