Challenges with Actor Critic Methods
Actor critic methods, despite their effectiveness, face significant drawbacks. One common issue is the unexplained drop in agent performance. This happens because, in deep reinforcement learning, we use neural networks to approximate mathematical functions, particularly the optimal policy. The true optimal policy's dependence on environmental parameters is much less elastic than the neural network's dependence on its internal parameters. Small changes in the network parameters can lead to large, often detrimental changes in the true policy.
