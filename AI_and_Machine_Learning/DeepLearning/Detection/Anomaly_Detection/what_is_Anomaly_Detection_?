Anomaly Detection is a technique used in data analysis to identify unusual patterns, outliers, or rare events that do not conform to expected behavior in a dataset. These anomalies may indicate critical incidents such as fraud, system failures, or any deviations from the norm. Anomaly Detection is widely used in fields like cybersecurity, finance, healthcare, and manufacturing to detect potential problems early and take corrective actions. The methods for Anomaly Detection include statistical approaches, machine learning models like Isolation Forest, and deep learning techniques.
