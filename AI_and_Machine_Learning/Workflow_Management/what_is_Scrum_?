**Scrum** is an agile framework used for managing and completing complex projects, typically in software development. It emphasizes teamwork, accountability, and iterative progress toward a well-defined goal. Here are the key components and concepts of Scrum:

1. **Roles**:
   - **Product Owner**: Responsible for defining the features of the product and prioritizing tasks.
   - **Scrum Master**: Ensures that the Scrum process is followed, helps remove obstacles, and facilitates the team's work.
   - **Development Team**: A cross-functional group that works on developing the product.

2. **Artifacts**:
   - **Product Backlog**: A prioritized list of features, enhancements, or bug fixes needed for the product.
   - **Sprint Backlog**: A subset of the product backlog chosen to be completed during a Sprint (a time-boxed iteration).
   - **Increment**: The potentially shippable product output produced after each Sprint.

3. **Events**:
   - **Sprint**: A time-boxed period (usually 1-4 weeks) during which specific tasks from the sprint backlog are completed.
   - **Daily Scrum (Stand-up)**: A short meeting where team members report progress and discuss any obstacles.
   - **Sprint Review**: A meeting held at the end of the Sprint to demonstrate the work done and gather feedback.
   - **Sprint Retrospective**: A reflection on the Sprint's process, aimed at continuous improvement for the next iteration.

4. **Principles**:
   - **Iterative and Incremental**: Work is done in small increments, allowing for frequent reassessment and adaptation.
   - **Transparency**: Progress is visible to all stakeholders.
   - **Inspection and Adaptation**: The team regularly checks on progress and makes adjustments as needed.

Scrum is widely used for projects requiring flexibility, collaboration, and constant refinement of goals and processes.
