Use the CLI with CI systems
The Firebase CLI requires a browser to complete authentication, but the CLI is fully compatible with CI and other headless environments.

On a machine with a browser, install the Firebase CLI.

Start the signin process by running the following command:


firebase login:ci
Visit the URL provided, then log in using a Google account.

Print a new refresh token. The current CLI session will not be affected.

Store the output token in a secure but accessible way in your CI system.

Use this token when running firebase commands. You can use either of the following two options:

Option 1: Store the token as the environment variable FIREBASE_TOKEN. Your system will automatically use the token.

Option 2: Run all firebase commands with the --token TOKEN flag in your CI system.
This is the order of precedence for token loading: flag, environment variable, desired Firebase project.

Note: On any machine with the Firebase CLI installed, you can immediately revoke access for the specified token by running the following command: firebase logout --token TOKEN
