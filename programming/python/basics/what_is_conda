Conda is an open-source package management and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It was created for Python programs but can package and distribute software for any language.

Key features of Conda include:

1. **Package Management**: Conda allows you to install, update, and remove packages. It can install different versions of a package, and it automatically manages dependencies, ensuring that all required packages are installed and compatible with each other.

2. **Environment Management**: Conda enables you to create and manage isolated environments. This means you can have multiple versions of Python and other packages installed on the same system without conflicts. Each environment can have its own set of packages, separate from other environments.

3. **Cross-platform**: Conda works on Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it a versatile tool for developers who work across multiple operating systems.

4. **Broad Language Support**: While Conda was initially created for Python, it can be used to manage packages and environments for other programming languages as well.

5. **Integration with Anaconda**: Conda is part of the Anaconda distribution, which includes a wide range of scientific libraries and tools. Anaconda is widely used in data science, machine learning, and scientific computing.

By using Conda, you can ensure that your projects have the right dependencies and that different projects do not interfere with each other. This is particularly useful in data science and machine learning, where different projects might require different versions of libraries.
