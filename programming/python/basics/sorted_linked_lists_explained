A sorted linked list is a linked list where the elements are maintained in a sorted order, typically in ascending or descending order. In a sorted linked list, each node contains a data element and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. The list ensures that elements are always inserted in a way that maintains the sorted order.

Examples of Sorted Linked Lists:
Ascending Order Linked List:

Suppose we have a linked list where elements are stored in ascending order.
Example: 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 7 -> 9
Here, each node points to the next node in the list, and each subsequent node contains a value greater than or equal to the value of the previous node.
Descending Order Linked List:

In this case, elements are stored in descending order.
Example: 10 -> 8 -> 6 -> 4 -> 2
Each node points to the next node in the list, and each subsequent node contains a value less than or equal to the value of the previous node.
Sorted Linked List with String Elements:

A sorted linked list can also contain elements that are strings, sorted lexicographically.
Example: "apple" -> "banana" -> "cherry" -> "date" -> "fig"
Here, each node contains a string, and the list maintains alphabetical order.
