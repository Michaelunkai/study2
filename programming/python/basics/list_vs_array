Array
An array is a collection of elements, usually of the same type, stored in contiguous memory locations. Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.

List
A list in Python is a collection of elements that can be of different types and is mutable. Lists are versatile and can grow or shrink in size.

Comparison: List vs Array
Lists are more flexible, allowing different data types and dynamic resizing, while arrays are more efficient for fixed-type elements.

Examples:
Array (Python array module):
 
 
import array
numbers = array.array('i', [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
List:
 
 
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
List with mixed types:
 
 
mixed_list = [1, "apple", 3.14, True]
