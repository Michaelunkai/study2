Function
A function is a block of code designed to perform a specific task, which can be called or invoked when needed. Functions can take inputs (called parameters) and can return a value.

Examples of Functions (in Python):
 
 
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
 
 
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
 
 
def is_even(number):
    return number % 2 == 0
