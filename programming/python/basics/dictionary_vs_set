Dictionary
A dictionary in Python is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique, and each key is associated with a value. Dictionaries are mutable and unordered.

Set
A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable without duplicates.

Comparison: Dictionary vs Set
Dictionaries store key-value pairs for fast lookups, while sets store unique elements for fast membership tests.

Examples:
Dictionary:

person = {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}


Set:
 
 
fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
Dictionary with mixed types:
 
 
mixed_dict = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 25,
    "is_student": True,
    "scores": [85, 90, 78]
}
Usage:
Accessing Dictionary Value:
 
 
name = person["name"]
Adding to Set:
 
 
fruits.add("orange")
Checking Membership in Set:
 
 
is_banana_in_set = "banana" in fruits
