Transforming our Data
The data I’ll use for this tutorial will be simple raw text data of a movie review of one of my favorite movies, the lion king. I’m storing this data in a text file called “test.txt” that you can download here.

To start we will need to integer encode the data. We will do this using the following function:

def review_encode(s):
	encoded = [1]

	for word in s:
		if word.lower() in word_index:
			encoded.append(word_index[word.lower()])
		else:
			encoded.append(2)

	return encoded
Next we will open our text file, read in each of the reviews (in this case just one) and use the model to predict whether it is positive or negative.

with open("test.txt", encoding="utf-8") as f:
	for line in f.readlines():
		nline = line.replace(",", "").replace(".", "").replace("(", "").replace(")", "").replace(":", "").replace("\"","").strip().split(" ")
		encode = review_encode(nline)
		encode = keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences([encode], value=word_index["<PAD>"], padding="post", maxlen=250) # make the data 250 words long
		predict = model.predict(encode)
		print(line)
		print(encode)
		print(predict[0])
