What is a REST API?
A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and conventions for building and interacting with web services. It allows different systems to communicate with each other over the internet using standard HTTP methods.

Key Concepts of REST API:
Resources: Objects or representations of information that are managed by the API (e.g., users, posts, products).
Endpoints: URLs where resources can be accessed (e.g., https://api.example.com/users).
HTTP Methods: Actions you can perform on resources:
GET: Retrieve data
POST: Create new data
PUT: Update existing data
DELETE: Remove data
Headers: Metadata sent with the request (e.g., authentication tokens, content type).
Request Body: Data sent with POST or PUT requests.
Step-by-Step Guide to Using a REST API
Step 1: Understand the API Documentation
API Documentation: This is the guide provided by the API provider that explains how to use the API, including available endpoints, required parameters, and response formats.
Example Documentation: Let's consider the JSONPlaceholder API, a free fake API for testing and prototyping: JSONPlaceholder.
Step 2: Making a GET Request
Objective: Retrieve data from the API.
Tool: Use tools like curl, Postman, or any programming language (e.g., Python's requests library).
Using curl:

 
 
curl -X GET "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts"
Using Python:

 
 
import requests

response = requests.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts')
print(response.json())
This will fetch a list of posts from the API.

Step 3: Making a POST Request
Objective: Create a new resource.
Tool: Use tools like curl, Postman, or any programming language (e.g., Python's requests library).
Using curl:

 
 
curl -X POST "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title": "foo", "body": "bar", "userId": 1}'
Using Python:

 
 
import requests

data = {
    "title": "foo",
    "body": "bar",
    "userId": 1
}
response = requests.post('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts', json=data)
print(response.json())
This will create a new post.

Step 4: Making a PUT Request
Objective: Update an existing resource.
Tool: Use tools like curl, Postman, or any programming language (e.g., Python's requests library).
Using curl:

 
 
curl -X PUT "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id": 1, "title": "foo", "body": "bar", "userId": 1}'
Using Python:

 
 
import requests

data = {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "foo",
    "body": "bar",
    "userId": 1
}
response = requests.put('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1', json=data)
print(response.json())
This will update the post with ID 1.

Step 5: Making a DELETE Request
Objective: Delete an existing resource.
Tool: Use tools like curl, Postman, or any programming language (e.g., Python's requests library).
Using curl:

 
 
curl -X DELETE "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1"
Using Python:

 
 
import requests

response = requests.delete('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1')
print(response.status_code)
This will delete the post with ID 1.
