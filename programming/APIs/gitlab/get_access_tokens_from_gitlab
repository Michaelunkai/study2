To get your personal GitLab access token, follow these steps:

Log into GitLab:

Go to gitlab.com and log in with your credentials.
Navigate to User Settings:

In the top-right corner, click on your profile icon.
Select "Edit Profile" or "Settings" from the dropdown menu.
Access Token Section:

In the left-hand menu, click on "Access Tokens".
Create a Personal Access Token:

In the "Personal Access Tokens" section, you’ll see a form to generate a new token.
Give your token a name under "Name".
Set the expiry date if needed (optional).
Select the required scopes based on what you need the token for (e.g., api, read_user, read_repository).
Generate the Token:

Click the "Create personal access token" button.
Once created, you will see the token on the screen. Copy it immediately, as you won’t be able to see it again.
Save the Token:

Store it securely, as this token will be used for Git operations or API access.
Now you can use this token in your GitLab commands or in API requests.
