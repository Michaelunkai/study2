Here’s a detailed step-by-step guide on how to get a Facebook Access Token for free:

### 1. **Create a Facebook Developer Account**
   - Go to [Facebook for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/) and log in with your Facebook credentials.
   - If you're not already a developer, you’ll need to create a developer account by clicking on **Get Started** and following the instructions.

### 2. **Create a New Facebook App**
   - After logging in, click on **My Apps** in the top-right corner.
   - Click on **Create App**.
   - Select **For Everything Else** as the app type.
   - Fill in the necessary information such as the app name and your email address, then click **Create App ID**.
   - Complete the security check (CAPTCHA).

### 3. **Add Facebook Login to Your App**
   - In your app dashboard, click on **Set Up** under the **Facebook Login** section.
   - Choose the **Web** platform.
   - Add the **Site URL** of your app. For this example, you can just put `http://localhost` if you're testing locally.
   - Click **Save**.

### 4. **Get Your Access Token Using Graph API Explorer**
   - Go to the [Graph API Explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/).
   - In the dropdown menu at the top-right, select your newly created app.
   - Under **User or Page**, select **User Token**. It will automatically generate an access token based on your login session.
   
### 5. **Grant Necessary Permissions**
   - In the **Access Token** section, click on **Add a Permission**.
   - Add the following permissions if you want to retrieve group posts:
     - `groups_access_member_info`
     - `read_insights`
   - If you're testing with public data like a public group, you might not need any additional permissions.
   
### 6. **Generate the Access Token**
   - Click **Generate Access Token**.
   - A token will appear in the Access Token field.
   - You can now use this token to make API calls.

### 7. **Test Your Token**
   - You can test your token in the Graph API Explorer by making calls like:
     https://graph.facebook.com/{group-id}/feed?access_token={access-token}
   - Replace `{group-id}` with the actual Facebook group ID (in your case, `715153780127233`) and `{access-token}` with your access token.
   - This will return the latest posts from the group if the permissions allow it.

### 8. **Using the Access Token**
   - Now you can use this access token in your Python script or any other application.

Remember that **User Access Tokens** are short-lived (2 hours by default). You can extend this token using the **Access Token Debugger** or by enabling long-lived tokens for testing purposes. If you need permanent access, you’ll need to go through Facebook’s app review process.
