To get the Todoist API key, follow these steps:

1. **Sign in to Todoist**:
   - Go to the Todoist website and log in to your account.

2. **Navigate to the Integration Settings**:
   - Click on your profile picture or initials in the top-right corner.
   - Select "Settings" from the dropdown menu.
   - In the settings menu, navigate to the "Integrations" tab.

3. **Locate the API Key**:
   - In the "Integrations" section, you will see an area called "API token" or "API key."
   - Your API key should be displayed there. If not, there might be a button to reveal or generate the API key.

4. **Copy the API Key**:
   - Click the "Copy" button next to the API key to copy it to your clipboard.

Ensure you keep your API key secure and do not share it publicly, as it allows access to your Todoist account.

If you encounter any issues or the process has changed, you can refer to the [Todoist API documentation](https://developer.todoist.com) or contact Todoist support for further assistance.
