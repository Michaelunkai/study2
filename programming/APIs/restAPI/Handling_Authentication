Handling Authentication
Authentication is essential for securing your API and ensuring that only authorized users can access certain resources. Here are common methods of authentication:

Basic Authentication
Simple but insecure: Basic Authentication involves sending the username and password in the header encoded in Base64.
Not recommended for production unless used over HTTPS.
Example using curl:

 
 
curl -u username:password https://api.example.com/resource
Example using Python:

 
 
import requests

response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/resource', auth=('username', 'password'))
print(response.json())
Token-Based Authentication
Bearer Tokens: Commonly used method where the client sends a token in the header.
Tokens are usually obtained by logging in with credentials and then used for subsequent requests.
Example using curl:

 
 
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" https://api.example.com/resource
Example using Python:

 
 
import requests

headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TOKEN'
}
response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/resource', headers=headers)
print(response.json())
OAuth
OAuth is a more secure and flexible method for authorizing third-party applications to access user data without exposing credentials.

OAuth 2.0: Widely used for web applications, involves several steps to obtain access tokens.
Scopes: Define what resources the application can access.
Implementing OAuth can be complex and often requires library support or following detailed guides specific to the API provider.
