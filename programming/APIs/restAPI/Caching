Caching
Caching improves the performance of your API by storing responses and serving them for repeated requests, reducing the load on your server.

Types of Caching
Client-Side Caching: Use HTTP headers like Cache-Control and ETag.
Server-Side Caching: Use caching solutions like Redis or Memcached.
Example HTTP Headers for Caching:

Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600
ETag: "5d8c72a2c9c6b8c64d63c4e9a1f0a562"
