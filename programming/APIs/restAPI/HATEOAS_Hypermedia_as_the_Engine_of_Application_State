HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State)
HATEOAS is a constraint of REST APIs that allows clients to navigate the API through links provided in the responses, making the API more self-descriptive.

Example Response with HATEOAS
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "links": [
    {"rel": "self", "href": "/users/1"},
    {"rel": "friends", "href": "/users/1/friends"},
    {"rel": "posts", "href": "/users/1/posts"}
  ]
}
