Rest API (Representational State Transfer API) and OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) are related but serve different purposes in the world of web services and APIs. Here’s a comparison to understand their roles and differences:

### REST API

**Definition:**
- REST API is a set of rules and conventions for building and interacting with web services.
- It uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and focuses on resources (identified by URIs).

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Stateless:** Each request from a client to server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request.
- **Client-Server Architecture:** The client and server are independent; the client makes requests and the server processes them.
- **Cacheable:** Responses must define themselves as cacheable or not to prevent clients from reusing stale or inappropriate data.
- **Uniform Interface:** REST defines a uniform interface between clients and servers to simplify and decouple the architecture.

**Usage:**
- REST APIs are used for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) resources on a server.
- Commonly used in web applications, mobile applications, and other software systems.

### OpenAPI

**Definition:**
- OpenAPI is a specification for describing and documenting RESTful APIs.
- It provides a standard, language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which allows humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without accessing the source code or additional documentation.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Documentation:** OpenAPI files are written in YAML or JSON format and describe the structure, endpoints, request/response models, and authentication methods of an API.
- **Interoperability:** Tools can automatically generate client libraries, server stubs, and API documentation from OpenAPI definitions.
- **Standardization:** It offers a standardized way of defining APIs, which helps in maintaining consistency across different APIs.

**Usage:**
- Used by API developers to create comprehensive API documentation.
- Can be used to generate interactive API documentation (e.g., Swagger UI), which allows users to test endpoints directly from the documentation.
- Supports auto-generating client SDKs and server stubs in various programming languages.

### Comparison

1. **Purpose:**
   - **REST API:** A set of principles and methods for building and interacting with web services.
   - **OpenAPI:** A specification for describing and documenting REST APIs.

2. **Functionality:**
   - **REST API:** Focuses on how to build and design the API endpoints and interactions.
   - **OpenAPI:** Focuses on describing the API’s structure, endpoints, and expected behavior.

3. **Implementation:**
   - **REST API:** Implemented through code and follows RESTful principles.
   - **OpenAPI:** Implemented as a document (YAML/JSON) that describes the REST API.

4. **Tools and Ecosystem:**
   - **REST API:** Frameworks like Express (Node.js), Flask (Python), Spring Boot (Java), etc.
   - **OpenAPI:** Tools like Swagger UI, OpenAPI Generator, Swagger Editor, etc.

### Conclusion

While a REST API is a method for building web services, OpenAPI is a specification used to describe these services. Using OpenAPI to document a REST API can significantly enhance its usability, maintainability, and interoperability.
