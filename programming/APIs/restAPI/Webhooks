Webhooks
Webhooks allow your API to send real-time notifications to other systems when certain events occur.

Implementing a Webhook
Define Events: Identify events that will trigger the webhook (e.g., new user registration).
Send HTTP POST: Send an HTTP POST request to a specified URL when the event occurs.
Example in Python:

import requests

def send_webhook(data):
    url = "https://webhook.site/your-webhook-url"
    response = requests.post(url, json=data)
    print(response.status_code)

# Example event
new_user_data = {"username": "johndoe", "email": "john@example.com"}
send_webhook(new_user_data)
