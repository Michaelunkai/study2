Logging and Monitoring
Logging and monitoring are crucial for maintaining the health and performance of your API.

Logging
Request and Response Logs: Log details of incoming requests and outgoing responses.
Error Logs: Log errors with sufficient context for debugging.
Example in Python (using Flask and logging):

import logging
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

@app.before_request
def log_request_info():
    app.logger.info(f"Request: {request.method} {request.url}")
    app.logger.info(f"Headers: {request.headers}")
    app.logger.info(f"Body: {request.get_data()}")

@app.route("/resource")
def get_resource():
    return {"message": "Hello, world!"}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
Monitoring
Tools: Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or New Relic to monitor API performance.
Metrics: Track metrics like request rates, error rates, response times, and system resource usage.
