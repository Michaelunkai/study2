GraphQL and REST are two different architectural approaches for building APIs and handling data exchange between clients and servers. Here's an in-depth comparison of their key differences:
Data Fetching Approach
REST: Clients access data by making separate HTTP requests to predefined endpoints (URLs) that represent resources. Each endpoint returns a fixed data structure defined by the server.
GraphQL: Clients describe the data requirements using a query language. A single GraphQL request can fetch data from multiple resources, returning only the specified fields in the desired shape.
Data Structure and Typing
REST: Data is typically returned in a format like JSON or XML with a loosely defined structure. The client needs to parse and interpret the response.
GraphQL: GraphQL has a strongly typed schema that defines the data structure and relationships. Clients know exactly what data they will receive, ensuring type safety.
Over/Under-fetching
REST: Due to fixed resource structures, clients may receive more data than needed (over-fetching) or require multiple requests to fetch all necessary data (under-fetching).
GraphQL: Clients can specify precisely the data they need, avoiding over-fetching and under-fetching issues.
Caching
REST: Caching is straightforward as each resource has a unique URL that can be cached independently.
GraphQL: Caching is more complex due to dynamic queries, but techniques like persisted queries and automatic persisted queries can help.
Versioning
REST: API versioning is typically handled by creating new endpoints or URL structures, leading to potential endpoint proliferation.
GraphQL: The schema can evolve without versioning by adding, deprecating, or changing fields. Existing queries continue to work as expected.
Performance
REST: Multiple round trips may be required to fetch related data, increasing latency and network overhead.
GraphQL: Data from multiple resources can be fetched in a single request, potentially improving performance and reducing network overhead.
Use Cases
REST is well-suited for simple data structures, CRUD operations, and scenarios where caching is crucial.
GraphQL shines in complex data requirements, frequently changing data shapes, and scenarios where minimizing network requests is important (e.g., mobile apps, single-page applications).
While GraphQL and REST have distinct strengths, they can coexist and complement each other within an application architecture. Some organizations adopt a hybrid approach, using GraphQL for complex data requirements and REST for simpler use cases or legacy systems.
