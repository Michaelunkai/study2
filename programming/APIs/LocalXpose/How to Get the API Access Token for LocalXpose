# Step-by-Step Tutorial: **How to Get the API Access Token for LocalXpose**  
## (LocalXpose Setup Guide for Generating and Retrieving Access Token)

### **1. Create a LocalXpose Account**
   - If you do not already have a LocalXpose account, visit the official website:  
     ```  
     https://localxpose.io  
     ```  
   - Click on **Sign Up** and provide the necessary details (email and password) to create your account.  
   - If you already have an account, click on **Log In** and enter your credentials.

---

### **2. Access the LocalXpose Dashboard**
   - After logging in, you will be redirected to the **LocalXpose Dashboard**.  
   - The dashboard is the central location for all settings and configurations.

---

### **3. Locate the "Access Token" Section**
   - On the left-hand menu (sidebar), look for a section called **Access** or **Tokens**.  
     - Alternatively, go to the **Settings** tab if you do not immediately see it.  
   - Click on **Access** or **Tokens** to proceed.

---

### **4. Generate an Access Token**
   - If no token is generated yet, click on the **Generate Token** button.  
   - LocalXpose will immediately create a new **Access Token** for you.  
   - This token is unique to your account and is required for authentication.

---

### **5. Copy the Access Token**
   - After the token is generated, it will be displayed on the screen.  
   - Click the **Copy** button or manually highlight and copy the token to your clipboard.  
   - Example of a token:  
     ```  
     xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx  
     ```  

---

### **6. Store the Token Securely**
   - Save the token in a safe location, such as a password manager or a secure text file, to avoid losing it.  
   - **Do not share this token publicly** since it is linked to your account.

---

### **7. Verify Your Token (Optional)**
   - To confirm your token works, you can run a test command using the LocalXpose CLI.  
   - Install LocalXpose CLI if not already installed:  

     #### **Installation (Linux/macOS)**  
     ```bash
     curl -s https://api.localxpose.io/downloads/cli/install.sh | bash
     ```

     #### **Installation (Windows)**  
     Download the executable from:  
     ```  
     https://localxpose.io/downloads  
     ```  

   - Run the following command in the terminal (replace `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` with your token):  
     ```bash
     loclx auth YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
     ```  
   - If successful, you will see a confirmation message.

---

### **Final Notes**
   - Your **Access Token** is required for using LocalXpose features such as tunnels and secure access.  
   - If you lose the token, you can always regenerate it from the dashboard, but remember to update any scripts or tools using the old token.  

By following these steps, you can successfully generate and retrieve your LocalXpose Access Token.
