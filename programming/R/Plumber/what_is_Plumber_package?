The **Plumber** package in R is a powerful tool for building **RESTful APIs** directly from R code. It allows you to turn your R scripts into APIs by adding special comments (annotations) to your R functions. These APIs can then be used to interact with your R code through HTTP requests (e.g., GET, POST).

### Key Features:
1. **Ease of Use**: You can quickly create APIs without requiring in-depth knowledge of web servers.
2. **Integration**: Ideal for integrating R's analytical and machine learning models into other applications or workflows.
3. **Flexibility**: Supports multiple HTTP methods, middleware, and custom error handling.

### Common Use Cases:
- Exposing predictive models created in R to other systems.
- Automating data processing tasks.
- Creating dashboards or web services powered by R.

### Example Workflow:
1. Define an R function.
2. Add Plumber annotations to specify the endpoint and HTTP method (e.g., `#* @get /endpoint`).
3. Deploy the API using Plumber, allowing it to listen for HTTP requests.

For instance, a simple API to return a random number could look like this:
 R
# plumber.R

#* @apiTitle Random Number API

#* Generate a random number
#* @get /random
function() {
  list(number = runif(1))
}

When hosted, you can make a GET request to `/random` to receive a random number as a response.

**Plumber** is highly useful for data scientists and developers who want to make their R models and functions accessible to other tools or systems.
