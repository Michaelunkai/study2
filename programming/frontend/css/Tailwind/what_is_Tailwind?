Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to build custom designs directly in their HTML by using pre-defined classes. It provides a set of low-level utility classes, such as `text-center`, `mt-4`, and `bg-blue-500`, that can be composed to build any design, without needing to write custom CSS. This approach enables faster development and makes it easier to maintain and scale the design system. Tailwind is popular in modern web development for its flexibility and the ability to create highly customizable and responsive designs.
