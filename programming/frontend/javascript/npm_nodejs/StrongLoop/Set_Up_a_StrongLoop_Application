Set Up a StrongLoop Application
After installing StrongLoop, you can use the StrongLoop CLI to scaffold a new application.

Step 4.1: Create a New Directory for the Project
First, create a new directory where your project will be located:

 
 
mkdir my-strongloop-app
cd my-strongloop-app
Step 4.2: Initialize a New Application
Now, initialize a new LoopBack application using the slc command:

 
 
slc loopback
You will be prompted to enter some basic configuration for your app. You can accept the default options or customize them as needed.

Alternatively, you can run the following:

 
 
slc app
Step 4.3: Install Application Dependencies
Once the app is initialized, install its dependencies using npm:

 
 
npm install


Run the Application
Once everything is set up, you can start the server and run your application.

Step 5.1: Start the Application
To start the application, run:

 
 
node .
By default, the application will run on port 3000. You can access it at http://localhost:3000.
