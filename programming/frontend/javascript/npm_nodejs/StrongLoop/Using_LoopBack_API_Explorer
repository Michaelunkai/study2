Using LoopBack API Explorer
The LoopBack API Explorer allows you to interact with your APIs, view the available endpoints, and execute requests directly from the browser.

Step 6.1: Access the API Explorer
To access the API Explorer, navigate to the following URL in your web browser:

 
 
http://localhost:3000/explorer
The API Explorer interface will show you all available API endpoints, including routes for your models, and let you test them interactively.

Step 6.2: Customizing the Explorer Path
If you wish to customize the URL path where the API Explorer is served (e.g., changing /explorer to /api-docs), you can modify the configuration in the server.js file:

javascript
 
const explorer = require('@loopback/openapi-v3').RestExplorerComponent;
app.component(explorer);
app.configure(RestExplorerBindings.COMPONENT).to({
  path: '/api-docs',
});
