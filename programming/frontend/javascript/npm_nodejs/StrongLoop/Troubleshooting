Troubleshooting
Here are some common issues you may encounter:

Issue 8.1: Permission Errors During npm Install
If you encounter permission errors, use nvm to install Node.js without needing sudo:

 
 
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
source ~/. rc
nvm install --lts
Reinstall StrongLoop without using sudo:

 
 
npm install -g strongloop
Issue 8.2: Port Already in Use
If the default port 3000 is already in use, specify a different port:

 
 
PORT=3001 node .
Issue 8.3: Application Fails to Start
Check Logs: Look for error messages in the terminal.
Verify Dependencies: Ensure all required npm packages are installed.
Node Version Compatibility: Ensure that your Node.js version is compatible with StrongLoop.
