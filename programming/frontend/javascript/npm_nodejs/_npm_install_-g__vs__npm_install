The difference between `npm install -g` and `npm install` lies in the scope and location where the package will be installed:

### `npm install -g`
- **Global Installation**: The `-g` flag stands for global. When you use `npm install -g`, you are installing the package globally on your system.
- **Location**: The package is installed in a system directory (e.g., `/usr/local/lib/node_modules` on Unix-like systems or `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules` on Windows).
- **Usage**: Globally installed packages are available from any directory on your system. This is typically used for command-line tools or utilities that you want to use anywhere.

### Example:
  
npm install -g eslint
- After running this, you can use the `eslint` command from anywhere on your system.

### `npm install`
- **Local Installation**: Without the `-g` flag, `npm install` installs the package locally in the `node_modules` directory of your current project.
- **Location**: The package is installed in the `node_modules` directory within your project folder.
- **Usage**: Locally installed packages are only available within the context of your project. This is the standard way to install dependencies for a project.

### Example:
  
npm install loda 
- After running this, you can use `lodash` in your project by requiring or importing it in your code files, but you can't use it as a command-line tool unless you specify the path.

### Key Points:
- **Global (`-g`)**: Installs the package globally, making it accessible from anywhere in your terminal.
- **Local**: Installs the package locally in your project's `node_modules` directory, making it accessible only within your project.

### When to Use:
- **Global**: Use for CLI tools and utilities that you need to use in multiple projects or from the command line directly.
- **Local**: Use for project-specific dependencies that are part of your project's codebase.

Choosing the correct installation method depends on whether you need the package globally (for system-wide access) or locally (for project-specific use).
