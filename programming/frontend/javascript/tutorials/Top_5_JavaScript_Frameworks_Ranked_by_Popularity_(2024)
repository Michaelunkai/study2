As of 2024, the most popular JavaScript frameworks are:

1. **React.js**: Developed by Facebook, React.js remains a top choice for building user interfaces due to its efficient virtual DOM, component-based architecture, and strong community support. It’s widely used for creating single-page applications (SPAs) and interactive web interfaces【6†source】【9†source】.

2. **Angular**: Backed by Google, Angular is known for its powerful features like two-way data binding, a component-based structure, and built-in support for TypeScript. It's popular for developing large-scale enterprise applications【7†source】【8†source】.

3. **Vue.js**: Vue.js is praised for its simplicity and flexibility, making it suitable for both small and large-scale projects. It features a gentle learning curve, two-way data binding, and a reactive data model, which help in building dynamic user interfaces efficiently【7†source】【9†source】.

4. **Node.js**: Although not a front-end framework, Node.js is essential for server-side development. It's built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and is renowned for its speed, non-blocking I/O, and scalability, making it ideal for data-intensive applications【6†source】.

5. **Svelte**: Svelte is gaining popularity due to its unique approach of shifting the work to compile time rather than runtime, resulting in highly optimized and fast applications. It provides a clean syntax and reduces boilerplate code, making it an appealing choice for developers seeking performance and simplicity【7†source】【8†source】.

These frameworks continue to evolve, each offering distinct advantages depending on the project's requirements and the developers' preferences.
