**Bun** is a fast, all-in-one JavaScript runtime that includes a bundler, transpiler, task runner, and package manager. It's designed as an alternative to Node.js, providing improved performance and better developer experience for JavaScript and TypeScript projects.

### Key Features of Bun:
- **Runtime**: Bun runs JavaScript and TypeScript code, similar to Node.js, but with a focus on speed and efficiency.
- **Bundler**: It can bundle JavaScript and TypeScript files for production, optimizing them for better performance.
- **Transpiler**: Bun supports TypeScript and modern JavaScript syntax out of the box, transpiling them to code that can run in environments that don't natively support these features.
- **Package Manager**: It has a built-in package manager that installs dependencies faster than npm or Yarn.
- **Task Runner**: Bun includes a task runner to automate repetitive tasks like building, testing, and linting code.
