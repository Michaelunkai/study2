Meteor is an open-source, full-stack platform for building web and mobile applications. It provides a set of tools and frameworks that streamline the development process. Key features include:

- **Real-time Data**: Meteor supports real-time data updates, making it easier to build applications where the user interface reflects the latest data without requiring manual refreshes.
- **Integrated Stack**: It includes a set of built-in tools for developing and deploying applications, such as a development server, database integration, and a build system.
- **JavaScript-Based**: Meteor allows you to use JavaScript on both the client and server sides, which can simplify development and reduce context switching.
- **Easy Deployment**: It includes tools for easy deployment and scaling of applications.
