LokiJS is a lightweight, fast, and in-memory JavaScript-based database that provides document-oriented data storage similar to MongoDB. It is designed to be used in applications where quick access to data is crucial, such as in-memory caching, client-side databases, or real-time analytics. LokiJS is particularly well-suited for environments where persistence to disk is optional, and the primary need is speed and efficiency in querying and managing data entirely in memory. It supports features like indexing, filtering, and dynamic views, making it versatile for various use cases.
