**Haskell** is a **functional programming language** known for its strong static typing, purity (functions have no side effects), and lazy evaluation (expressions are evaluated only when needed). It is named after the mathematician **Haskell Curry**.

Key features of Haskell include:
- **Pure Functions**: Haskell enforces the concept of pure functions, meaning functions always produce the same output for the same input and have no side effects.
- **Type System**: Haskell has a strong, static type system with type inference, meaning types are known at compile time, reducing runtime errors.
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Code is evaluated only when necessary, allowing for potentially more efficient execution and enabling infinite data structures.
- **Immutability**: Data cannot be modified after it is created, which leads to safer and more predictable code.

Haskell is widely used in academic research, but it is also employed in industry for tasks requiring high reliability, concurrency, and mathematical precision.
