Maven is a build automation and project management tool primarily used in Java projects. It provides a standardized way to manage a project's build process, dependencies, and documentation. Maven uses a configuration file called `pom.xml` (Project Object Model) to define project structure, dependencies, build order, and more. It simplifies the process of managing and resolving dependencies, running tests, packaging, and deploying applications, making it a widely adopted tool in Java development.
