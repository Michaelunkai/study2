### Black Box Testing vs. Gray Box Testing vs. White Box Testing: An Explanation

**Black Box Testing** is a software testing method where the tester evaluates the functionality of the software without looking into its internal structures or workings. The tester is only aware of the inputs and expected outputs, but not how the software processes these inputs to generate the outputs. This approach is useful for validating the software's external behavior and ensuring it meets user requirements.

**Gray Box Testing** is a hybrid approach that combines elements of both Black Box and White Box testing. In this method, the tester has partial knowledge of the internal workings of the application. This knowledge is used to design test cases that focus on both the functional and structural aspects of the software. Gray Box Testing is beneficial in identifying context-specific issues and integrating testing efforts across different layers of the application.

**White Box Testing** (also known as Clear Box, Open Box, or Glass Box testing) involves testing the internal structures or workings of an application. The tester has full access to the source code and uses this knowledge to design test cases. This method is particularly useful for optimizing code, enhancing security, and ensuring that internal operations perform as expected.
