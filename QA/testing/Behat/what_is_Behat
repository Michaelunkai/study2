Behat is an open-source Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) framework for PHP. It allows developers and testers to write human-readable test scenarios in a natural language (typically in Gherkin syntax), which can then be executed to test the behavior of a web application. The primary goal of Behat is to facilitate collaboration between developers, testers, and non-technical stakeholders by making the testing process more understandable and accessible.

Behat integrates with Mink, which simulates browser interactions, enabling the testing of web applications in an environment that closely resembles real user interactions. The test scenarios written in Behat can cover a wide range of behaviors, from simple form submissions to complex user interactions across multiple pages.
