To set up and run the project from the Keploy repository in Ubuntu, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, you need to clone the Keploy repository to your local machine.

  
git clone https://github.com/keploy/keploy.git
cd keploy

### 2. Install Keploy
You can install Keploy using the provided installation script:

  
curl --silent -O -L https://keploy.io/install.sh && source install.sh

This script will download and install Keploy on your system.

### 3. Record API Calls as Test Cases
To record API calls, use the `keploy record` command. Replace `CMD_TO_RUN_APP` with the command to run your application.

For example, if your application is a Python app:

  
keploy record -c "python main.py"

### 4. Run the Recorded Tests
After recording, you can run the tests using the following command. Replace `CMD_TO_RUN_APP` with the command to run your application again:

  
keploy test -c "python main.py" --delay 10

The `--delay` option allows the application to start before Keploy begins testing.

### 5. (Optional) Integrate with Test Coverage Tools
If you want to integrate Keploy with your unit-testing framework to combine test coverage, follow the [test coverage integration guide](https://keploy.io/docs/test-coverage).

### 6. Explore Further Documentation
Keploy has extensive documentation for additional features and integrations. You can explore more at the [Keploy Documentation](https://keploy.io/docs).

### 7. Running in CI/CD Pipeline or Kubernetes
You can also integrate Keploy with CI/CD pipelines or run it across Kubernetes clusters by following the guidelines provided in the repository.

This setup should get you started with Keploy in your Ubuntu environment.
