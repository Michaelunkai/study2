Allure is an open-source framework designed to generate comprehensive and customizable test reports. It works by aggregating data from various testing frameworks, like JUnit, TestNG, or Pytest, and presenting it in an easy-to-read HTML format. Allure helps in visualizing test results, identifying failures, and understanding the context of those failures through detailed logs, screenshots, and step-by-step test execution details. This makes it particularly useful for quality assurance (QA) teams in continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) environments.
