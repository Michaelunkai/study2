If your project is not accessible from outside or if you want to test your localhost, you might want to run your own instance of Yellow Lab Tools.

The classical way is to clone the YLT server's GitHub repository and run it on Linux or MacOS. The documentation is here.

The new recommended solution is to run Yellow Lab Tools inside a Docker virtual machine. My friend Ousama Ben Younes maintains this ready-to-use Docker image based on Alpine).
