A QA (Quality Assurance) load test is a type of performance testing used to evaluate how an application behaves under a specific expected load. The purpose of a load test is to ensure that the application can handle a certain number of concurrent users or requests without performance degradation, errors, or crashes.

### Key Aspects of a QA Load Test:
- **Concurrent Users**: Simulates the behavior of multiple users accessing the application at the same time.
- **Requests**: Measures how many requests per second the application can handle.
- **Response Time**: Tracks how quickly the application responds to user actions.
- **Throughput**: Assesses the amount of data transferred over the network during the test.
- **Stability**: Ensures that the application remains stable under load without crashing or showing significant performance issues.

Load testing is critical for identifying performance bottlenecks and ensuring the application can perform reliably under real-world usage conditions.
