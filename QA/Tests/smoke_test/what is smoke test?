A smoke test is a type of software testing that quickly evaluates whether the most critical functions of an application work correctly. It is often called a "build verification test" because it checks whether the software build is stable enough for more thorough testing. Smoke tests are not exhaustive; they focus on the core functionality and are typically run after a new build or update to ensure that the application doesn't have major issues before proceeding to more detailed testing phases. If a smoke test fails, the build is typically rejected, and further testing is halted until the issues are resolved.
