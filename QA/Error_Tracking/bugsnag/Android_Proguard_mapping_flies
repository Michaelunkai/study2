Android Proguard mapping flies
If you are using ProGuard, DexGuard, or R8 to minify and optimize your app, this command uploads the mapping file along with version information from your project directory:

$ bugsnag-cli upload android-proguard app/build/outputs/proguard/release/mapping.txt
See the upload android-proguard command reference for full usage information.
