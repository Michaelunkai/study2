 Sending Test Events to Sentry
To test that Sentry is working, integrate the Sentry SDK into one of your applications. For example, in a Python project:

Install the Sentry SDK:

 
 
pip install --upgrade sentry-sdk
Initialize Sentry in your Python code:

 
 
import sentry_sdk
sentry_sdk.init("http://your-dsn-url")
Trigger a test error:

 
 
division_by_zero = 1 / 0
This error will be captured and displayed on your Sentry dashboard.
