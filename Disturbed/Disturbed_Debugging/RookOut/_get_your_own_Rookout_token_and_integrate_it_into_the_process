Here’s how you can get your own Rookout token and integrate it into the process:

### **Step 1: Sign Up for a Rookout Account**

1. Go to the [Rookout Website](https://www.rookout.com/).
2. Click on the **"Get Started"** or **"Sign Up"** button.
3. You can sign up using your email or use your existing GitHub, Google, or other login providers.
4. After signing up, you’ll be directed to the Rookout dashboard.

### **Step 2: Retrieve Your Rookout Token**

1. Once inside the dashboard, you’ll be prompted to **create a new project**.
2. After creating the project, you will see your **ROOKOUT_TOKEN** displayed on the project page.
   - This token is required to authenticate the Rookout agent.

### **Step 3: Integrate Rookout Token into Your Application**

1. Copy the **ROOKOUT_TOKEN** from the Rookout dashboard.
2. Use this token in the setup process:

   - When running the installation script:
       
     sudo ./setup.sh --token=<YOUR_ROOKOUT_TOKEN>

   - When adding it to your application, for example in Python:
       
     rook.start(token='YOUR_ROOKOUT_TOKEN')

### **Step 4: Continue Debugging Setup**

Now that you have your Rookout token, continue following the steps to install the Rookout agent and integrate it with your application for distributed debugging.
