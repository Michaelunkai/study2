## Comprehensive Guide to Network Bonding on Ubuntu: Step-by-Step Instructions

Network bonding, also known as link aggregation, is a method of combining multiple network interfaces into a single logical interface to increase bandwidth and provide redundancy. This guide will take you through the complete process of setting up network bonding on Ubuntu, from start to finish.

### Step 1: Update Your System and Install Necessary Packages

First, ensure your system is up to date and install the `ifenslave` package, which is required for bonding.

  
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ifenslave

### Step 2: Load the Bonding Kernel Module

Load the bonding kernel module:

  
sudo modprobe bonding

To ensure the bonding module loads at boot, add it to the `/etc/modules` file:

  
echo "bonding" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules

### Step 3: Configure Network Interfaces

Depending on your Ubuntu version, you'll configure network interfaces using either Netplan (for Ubuntu 18.04 and later) or `/etc/network/interfaces` (for older versions).

#### For Ubuntu 18.04 and Later (Using Netplan)

1. Open the Netplan configuration file. You might need to adjust the filename to match your configuration:

  
sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-netcfg. 

2. Add the following configuration, adjusting the interface names (`enp0s3`, `enp0s8`) and bond options as needed:

  
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    enp0s3:
      dhcp4: no
    enp0s8:
      dhcp4: no
  bonds:
    bond0:
      interfaces:
        - enp0s3
        - enp0s8
      addresses:
        - 192.168.1.100/24
      gateway4: 192.168.1.1
      nameservers:
        addresses:
          - 8.8.8.8
          - 8.8.4.4
      parameters:
        mode: active-backup
        primary: enp0s3

3. Apply the Netplan configuration:

  
sudo netplan apply

#### For Older Versions of Ubuntu (Using `/etc/network/interfaces`)

1. Edit the network interfaces file:

  
sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces

2. Add the following configuration, adjusting the interface names and bond options as needed:

 plaintext
auto bond0
iface bond0 inet static
    address 192.168.1.100
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    gateway 192.168.1.1
    dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
    bond-mode active-backup
    bond-miimon 100
    bond-slaves enp0s3 enp0s8

auto enp0s3
iface enp0s3 inet manual
    bond-master bond0

auto enp0s8
iface enp0s8 inet manual
    bond-master bond0

3. Restart the networking service to apply the changes:

  
sudo systemctl restart networking

### Step 4: Verify the Bonding Configuration

Check the status of the bonded interface to ensure it is working correctly:

  
cat /proc/net/bonding/bond0

You should see output detailing the status of the bonded interfaces.

### Trouble ooting

If you encounter any issues, consider the following tips:

- Ensure the network interfaces are not managed by another service, such as NetworkManager.
- Double-check the configuration files for any syntax errors.
- Ensure the bonding module is loaded and active by running `lsmod | grep bonding`.

By following these steps, you should have successfully set up network bonding on your Ubuntu system. This setup provides increased bandwidth and redundancy, ensuring a more reliable and efficient network connection. If you have any further questions or run into issues, feel free to ask for assistance.
