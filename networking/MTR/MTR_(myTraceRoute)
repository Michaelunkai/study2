Understanding MTR (My TraceRoute)
MTR, short for My TraceRoute, is a network diagnostic tool that combines the functionality of both the ping and traceroute commands. It continuously sends packets to the destination and provides real-time statistics about the round-trip time and packet loss for each hop.

Top MTR Commands:

Basic MTR Command:

mtr www.google.com
This command runs a continuous trace route to Google's servers and displays detailed statistics.

Specify Number of Packets:

 
mtr -c 10 www.google.com
Adjust the number of packets to send for a more concise report. In this example, it's set to 10 packets.

Display DNS Information:

 
 
mtr --report-dns www.google.com
This option resolves IP addresses to hostnames, providing additional information about each hop.

Output Report to File:

 
 
mtr --report www.google.com > mtr_report.txt
Save the results to a file for further analysis or sharing with others.
