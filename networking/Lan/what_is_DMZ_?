A Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) in networking refers to a physical or logical subnetwork that separates an internal local area network (LAN) from untrusted external networks, usually the internet. The purpose of a DMZ is to add an extra layer of security to an organization's internal network by isolating and exposing external-facing services to the internet, while keeping the internal network protected from potential threats.
