HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure):
HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP. It uses SSL/TLS to encrypt communication between the web client and the server, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity. HTTPS is critical for securing web transactions, such as online banking, e-commerce, and protecting sensitive information. With HTTPS, the data is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS), which provides end-to-end encryption, protecting users from man-in-the-middle attacks. Most modern websites enforce HTTPS by default, making it an integral protocol for secure communication over the internet.
