Install tcpdump:

arduino
 
sudo apt-get install tcpdump
Check Current Network Interface:

 
 
ip -o -4 route show to default | awk '{print $5}'
This command will display the name of your default network interface.

Capture Traffic:

 
 
sudo tcpdump -i <interface>
Advanced Filters:

By Protocol (e.g., HTTP):
 
 
sudo tcpdump -i <interface> port 80
By Packet Size (e.g., larger than 1000 bytes):
 
 
sudo tcpdump -i <interface> greater 1000
By IP Address (e.g., specific IP address):
 
 
sudo tcpdump -i <interface> src <ip_address>
sudo tcpdump -i <interface> dst <ip_address>
Combining Filters:

 
 
sudo tcpdump -i <interface> src <ip_address> and tcp
Save Capture to a File:

 
 
sudo tcpdump -i <interface> -w capture.pcap
Analyze Capture File:

 
sudo tcpdump -r capture.pcap
Remember to replace <interface> with the actual interface name you found in step 2 and <ip_address> with the specific IP address you want to filter by. Also, use sudo to run tcpdump with root privileges.
