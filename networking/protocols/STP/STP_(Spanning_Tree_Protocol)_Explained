STP is a Layer 2 protocol designed to prevent network loops in Ethernet networks, which can cause broadcast storms and degrade network performance. In a redundant network setup, STP ensures that only a single active path exists between two network devices by blocking redundant paths and placing them in standby mode. If the active path fails, STP dynamically reconfigures the network by activating one of the standby paths, ensuring uninterrupted communication. The protocol operates by building a loop-free topology based on the lowest path cost, designated by bridge IDs. STP is crucial for maintaining network stability in environments with redundant links.
