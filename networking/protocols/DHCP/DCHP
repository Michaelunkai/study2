Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) automates IP address assignment on a network.
 When a device connects, DHCP allocates a unique IP address, subnet mask, gateway, and DNS information.
 This dynamic process simplifies network management,
 eliminating manual configuration. DHCP ensures efficient use of available IP 
addresses and helps prevent conflicts.
 Devices can seamlessly join and exit networks without manual intervention.
 DHCP streamlines connectivity, making it a fundamental service for modern networks
 by providing a dynamic and automated method for devices to obtain the necessary network parameters.
