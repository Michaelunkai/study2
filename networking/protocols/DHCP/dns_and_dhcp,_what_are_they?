DNS (Domain Name System):
DNS is like the internet's phonebook. Imagine you want to visit a website, like www.example.com. Instead of typing in the IP address (a series of numbers) associated with that website, you use its human-readable domain name. DNS translates these names into IP addresses, helping your computer locate the server hosting the website.

Here's a simplified breakdown of how DNS works:

User Input: You type a domain name (e.g., www.example.com) into your browser.

DNS Query: Your computer sends a request to a DNS server, asking for the IP address associated with the domain.

DNS Resolution: The DNS server looks up the domain's IP address and sends it back to your computer.

Connection: Now armed with the IP address, your computer can connect to the web server hosting the requested website.

DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):
DHCP is all about making life easier in a network by automatically assigning IP addresses and other network configuration information to devices. Instead of manually configuring each device with a static IP, DHCP dynamically manages and allocates IP addresses as devices connect to the network.

Key points about DHCP:

IP Address Assignment: When a device joins a network, it sends a DHCP request. The DHCP server responds by assigning an available IP address to that device.

Lease Time: IP addresses are leased for a specific duration. After that time, the device must renew its lease. This helps in managing and reorganizing IP address allocation.

Configuration Information: DHCP also provides additional information like subnet mask, default gateway, DNS servers, etc., making it easier for devices to join and communicate on the network.

Simplifies Administration: DHCP reduces the burden on network administrators, as they don't have to manually assign and track IP addresses for each device.

Together, DNS and DHCP play crucial roles in making our internet experience seamless and efficient
