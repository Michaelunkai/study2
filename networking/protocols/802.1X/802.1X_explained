802.1X is an IEEE standard for port-based Network Access Control (NAC), used to secure wired and wireless networks. It authenticates devices trying to connect to a network, ensuring that only authorized devices can gain access. 802.1X uses Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) for communication between the device (known as the supplicant), the network switch or access point (the authenticator), and the authentication server (usually a RADIUS server). The protocol is widely used in enterprise and campus networks, especially for securing Wi-Fi connections. Its implementation is crucial in protecting networks from unauthorized access, ensuring compliance with security policies.
