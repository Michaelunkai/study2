1. what is DNS, and what role it play in network communication?
answer: dns stand for Domain Name System.
it translates homan readable domain names (such as www.example.com) into ip adresses (like 192.0.2.1) that computers can use to communicate with each
other on the internet.
2. What is the difference between a forward lookup zone and a reverse lookup zone in DNS?
answer:
a forward lookup zone is used to map domain names to ip addresses, while a reverse lookup zone os used to map IP adresses to domain
names.
3. What are the steps to install and configure a DNS server on a Windows Server system?
Answer: The steps to install and configure a DNS server on a Windows Server system include
adding the DNS Server role, creating a forward lookup zone, and configuring the server's
network settings to use the local DNS server.
4. What is a DNS record, and what are some common types of DNS records?
Answer: A DNS record is an entry in a DNS database that maps a domain name to a specific
IP address or other resource. Common types of DNS records include A records (for IPv4
addresses), AAAA records (for IPv6 addresses), MX records (for email servers), and CNAME
records (for aliases).
5. What is a DNS cache, and how does it work?
Answer: A DNS cache is a temporary storage area on a client or server that contains recently
accessed DNS records. This allows the system to quickly retrieve DNS information without
having to perform a new DNS lookup.
6. What is DNS recursion, and how does it work?
Answer: DNS recursion is the process by which a DNS server queries other DNS servers to
resolve a domain name. It involves sending a query to a root DNS server, which then directs
the query to the appropriate top-level domain server, and so on until the domain name is
resolved.
7. What is a DNS forwarder, and how is it used?
Answer: A DNS forwarder is a server that is configured to forward DNS queries to another
DNS server. This can be used to improve DNS query performance, reduce network traffic, or
provide access to external DNS resources.
8. What is DNSSEC, and how does it improve DNS security?
Answer: DNSSEC is a set of security extensions to DNS that provide data integrity and
authentication for DNS records. It works by adding digital signatures to DNS records, which
can be verified to ensure that they have not been tampered with.
9. What is split-brain DNS, and how is it used?
Answer: Split-brain DNS (also known as split-horizon DNS) is a DNS configuration in which
different DNS responses are provided based on the location of the requesting client. This can
be used to provide different DNS resolution for internal and external clients.
10. What is a DNS load balancer, and how is it used?
Answer: A DNS load balancer is a server that is configured to distribute DNS queries across
multiple servers in a load-balanced configuration. This can be used to improve performance,
increase availability, or provide fault-tolerance for DNS services.
11. What is DNS round-robin, and how is it used?
Answer: DNS round-robin is a simple load balancing technique in which multiple IP
addresses are associated with a single domain name, and DNS servers alternate between the
IP addresses in a round-robin fashion to distribute traffic.
12. What is DNS aging and scavenging, and how is it used?
Answer: DNS aging and scavenging is a process by which DNS records that are no longer in
use are removed from a DNS database to prevent it from becoming bloated or outdated.
13. What is a DNS suffix, and how is it used?
Answer: A DNS suffix is a domain name that is
added to the end of a hostname to form a fully qualified domain name. It is used to resolve
unqualified domain names and simplify domain name resolution in a local network.
14. What is the difference between authoritative and non-authoritative DNS servers?
Answer: An authoritative DNS server is a server that has complete information about a
domain name and is responsible for providing DNS records for that domain. A nonauthoritative DNS server is a server that does not have complete information about a
domain name and must query other DNS servers to obtain the information.
15. What is a stub zone, and how is it used?
Answer: A stub zone is a read-only copy of a zone that contains only the information needed
to resolve domain names in that zone. It is used to provide name resolution for remote
locations that are not part of the same DNS domain.
16. What is a conditional forwarder, and how is it used?
Answer: A conditional forwarder is a server that is configured to forward DNS queries for a
specific domain to another DNS server. This can be used to provide efficient and secure
name resolution across multiple DNS domains.
17. What is the DNS Root Zone, and how does it work?
Answer: The DNS Root Zone is the top-level domain in the DNS hierarchy, consisting of the
root servers and their associated IP addresses. It serves as the starting point for all DNS
resolution on the internet.
18. What is Dynamic DNS, and how does it work?
Answer: Dynamic DNS is a system that allows clients to update their DNS records
automatically as their IP address changes. This is useful for servers that are assigned
dynamic IP addresses and need to maintain a consistent DNS name.
19. What is the difference between primary and secondary DNS zones?
Answer: A primary DNS zone is a zone that is stored locally on a DNS server and is
authoritative for that zone. A secondary DNS zone is a read-only copy of a primary zone that
is stored on another DNS server and is used for backup and redundancy.
20. What is DNS over HTTPS, and how does it improve DNS security?
Answer: DNS over HTTPS (DoH) is a protocol that allows DNS queries to be sent over an
encrypted HTTPS connection. This provides improved privacy and security for DNS queries,
as they cannot be intercepted or modified in transit1. what is DNS, and what role it play in network communication?
