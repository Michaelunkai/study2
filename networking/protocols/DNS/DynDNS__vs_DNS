DynDNS and DNS are related but serve different purposes in the realm of network management. Here’s a breakdown of both:

1. **DNS (Domain Name System)**:
   - **Function**: DNS is a system that translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network. Essentially, it acts like a phone book for the internet.
   - **Use Case**: Every time you visit a website by typing its domain name, your computer uses DNS to retrieve the corresponding IP address.
   - **Infrastructure**: Managed by various organizations around the world, DNS servers are hierarchical and distributed globally, ensuring redundancy and reducing distances for queries to travel.

2. **DynDNS (Dynamic DNS)**:
   - **Function**: Dynamic DNS is a service that automatically updates the DNS records for a domain in real-time as its IP address changes. This is particularly useful for devices with IP addresses that change frequently, such as those on residential internet connections.
   - **Use Case**: It’s often used in home networking, CCTV systems, remote desktop applications, or any server that must be reachable over the internet but doesn’t have a static IP address.
   - **Mechanism**: DynDNS providers offer software or hardware that detects changes in the IP address and updates the DNS record automatically.

While DNS provides the fundamental capability of translating domain names to IP addresses, DynDNS builds on this to accommodate frequently changing IP addresses, allowing continuous access without needing a static IP.
