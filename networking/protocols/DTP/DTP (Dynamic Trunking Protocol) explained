DTP is a Cisco proprietary protocol used to automatically negotiate the trunking state of ports between Cisco switches. When trunking is enabled, multiple VLANs can be carried across a single physical link. DTP helps determine whether to set the link as an access or trunk port dynamically. By simplifying VLAN management, DTP reduces the need for manual configuration in large-scale networks. DTP can operate in various modes such as “auto” or “desirable,” allowing for flexible and scalable network design. However, it can also pose security risks if not managed properly, as unintended trunk links may form, leading to VLAN leaks.
