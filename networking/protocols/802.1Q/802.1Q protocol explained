802.1Q is an IEEE standard that defines VLAN tagging in Ethernet frames. It allows for the separation of network traffic into different Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) while using a single physical connection between network devices. VLANs enable logical segmentation of networks, improving security, reducing broadcast domains, and enhancing network performance. The 802.1Q standard adds a 4-byte tag to Ethernet frames that contains VLAN identification information. Switches use this tag to forward traffic to the appropriate VLAN. By supporting multiple VLANs over a single trunk link, 802.1Q helps in simplifying network management and reducing infrastructure costs.
