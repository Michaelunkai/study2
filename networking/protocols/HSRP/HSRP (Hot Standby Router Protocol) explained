HSRP is a Cisco proprietary redundancy protocol for establishing a fault-tolerant default gateway in a network. In an HSRP setup, multiple routers work together to present the illusion of a single virtual router to hosts on a network. Only one router (the active router) forwards traffic, while the others remain on standby. If the active router fails, a standby router automatically takes over without interruption to network traffic. This ensures high availability and reliability in critical networks where downtime needs to be minimized. HSRP provides fast failover times and is commonly used in data centers and enterprise environments.
