CDP is a Cisco proprietary Layer 2 protocol used by Cisco devices to share information about other directly connected Cisco equipment, such as routers and switches. This protocol operates regardless of the Layer 3 protocols that are enabled and helps network administrators discover Cisco devices that are nearby even if Layer 3 information is unavailable. CDP is useful for network troubleshooting, enabling the identification of device names, IP addresses, interfaces, and capabilities. It periodically sends information about each device to neighboring devices, assisting with inventory management and network topology discovery in complex networks.
