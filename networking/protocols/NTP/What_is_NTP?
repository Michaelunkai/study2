Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a networking protocol designed to synchronize the clocks of computers over a network. It operates over the Internet Protocol (IP) and ensures that the time across different devices is accurate and consistent. NTP is crucial for time-sensitive applications, ensuring that all network devices share the same time, which is essential for logging events, coordinating tasks, and security protocols. The protocol uses a hierarchical system of time sources, with each level called a stratum, where lower stratum numbers indicate more accurate time sources.
