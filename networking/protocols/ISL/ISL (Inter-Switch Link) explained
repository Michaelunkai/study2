ISL is a Cisco proprietary VLAN encapsulation protocol used to interconnect switches and carry VLAN information across trunk links. Before 802.1Q became the industry standard for VLAN tagging, ISL was widely used in Cisco networks. It encapsulates entire Ethernet frames by adding a 30-byte header and CRC, enabling VLAN tagging and identifying which VLAN a particular frame belongs to. ISL supports up to 1000 VLANs, offering more capacity than traditional Ethernet networks. However, due to its proprietary nature and higher overhead compared to 802.1Q, ISL has largely been replaced by the IEEE standard, especially in non-Cisco networks.
