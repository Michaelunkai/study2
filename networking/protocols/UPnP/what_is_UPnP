UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) is a set of networking protocols that allows devices on a local network to discover each other and establish functional network services for data sharing, communications, and entertainment. It automates network configuration and enables seamless connectivity between devices such as computers, printers, gaming consoles, and media players, without requiring manual setup or user intervention. UPnP is commonly used for port forwarding on routers, making it easier for devices to communicate with the internet.
