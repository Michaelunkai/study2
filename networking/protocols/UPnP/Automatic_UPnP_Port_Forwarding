Automatic UPnP Port Forwarding (Optional)
If you want to automate the UPnP port forwarding process, you can create a script that runs the upnpc command at system startup or on a scheduled basis using cron.

Example Script:
 
 
#!/bin/ 
upnpc -a 192.168.1.100 8080 8080 TCP
Save the script as upnp_forward.sh, make it executable, and then add it to your cron jobs or startup applications.
