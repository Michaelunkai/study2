MPLS is a high-performance method of routing traffic across large networks. It assigns short labels to packets, which determine the path the packet will take through the network, bypassing traditional IP routing table lookups at each hop. MPLS is protocol-agnostic, meaning it can transport packets from various network protocols, including IP, ATM, and Ethernet. This flexibility allows for better traffic engineering, faster packet forwarding, and improved bandwidth utilization. MPLS is often used by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to offer services like VPNs and ensure Quality of Service (QoS) for voice, video, and other latency-sensitive applications.
