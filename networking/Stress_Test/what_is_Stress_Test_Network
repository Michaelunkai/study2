A **Stress Test Network** refers to a testing environment or process designed to assess the performance and stability of a network under extreme conditions. The goal is to simulate heavy loads or adverse situations to evaluate how well the network handles high traffic, potential failures, or unexpected behavior.

Key aspects of stress testing a network include:

1. **Traffic Generation:** Simulating a high volume of traffic to test the network's capacity and performance.
2. **Fault Injection:** Introducing faults or errors to see how the network responds and recovers.
3. **Performance Metrics:** Measuring various parameters such as throughput, latency, and packet loss under stress conditions.
4. **Scalability Testing:** Assessing how well the network scales with increased load or additional users.
5. **Resilience Testing:** Evaluating the network's ability to maintain functionality and recover from failures or disruptions.

Stress testing helps identify potential weaknesses and ensure that the network can handle real-world demands and maintain reliability under pressure.
