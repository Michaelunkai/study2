Run the command:


sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder

Test Ad Blocking:
Visit a site that typically displays ads (e.g., YouTube) and verify that ads are being blocked.

By following these steps, you will have set up a network-wide ad-blocking system using Pi-hole on Ubuntu WSL2. All devices connected to your network should now benefit from ad blocking.
