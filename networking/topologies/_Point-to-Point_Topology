Point-to-Point Topology
In a point-to-point topology, there is a direct connection between two devices.

Steps:
Set Up Network Interfaces:
Ensure the network interfaces on both devices are up.

 
 
sudo ip link set eth0 up
sudo ip link set eth1 up
Assign IP Addresses:

 
 
sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.2/24 dev eth0
sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.3/24 dev eth1
Configure Routing:
Set up routing to ensure direct communication between the two devices.

 
 
sudo ip route add 192.168.1.3/32 dev eth0
sudo ip route add 192.168.1.2/32 dev eth1
