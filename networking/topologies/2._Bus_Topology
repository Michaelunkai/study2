2. Bus Topology
In a bus topology, all devices are connected to a single central cable (the bus).

Steps:
Set Up Network Interfaces:
Ensure all network interfaces are up.

 
 
sudo ip link set eth0 up
sudo ip link set eth1 up
Configure Network Interfaces with IP Addresses:

 
 
sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.2/24 dev eth0
sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.3/24 dev eth1
Enable IP Forwarding:
Enable IP forwarding to allow data to pass between interfaces.

 
 
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
Set Up Routing Rules:
Add static routes if necessary.

 
 
sudo ip route add 192.168.1.0/24 dev eth0
sudo ip route add 192.168.1.0/24 dev eth1
