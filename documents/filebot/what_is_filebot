**FileBot** is a powerful and automated tool used primarily for organizing and renaming media files such as movies, TV shows, music, and anime. It helps manage large media libraries by fetching metadata (like titles, release dates, and episode names) from online databases, such as TheMovieDB, TheTVDB, OpenSubtitles, and more. 

FileBot can:
- **Rename files** automatically based on metadata.
- **Download subtitles** from online sources.
- **Organize media files** into folders using custom naming schemes.
- **Fetch and apply cover art** to media files.
- **Verify the integrity** of files using checksums.

It is popular for use in combination with media servers like Plex or Kodi to ensure that media files are properly named and categorized. FileBot has both a graphical user interface (GUI) and command-line interface (CLI), making it versatile for various workflows.
