 Install and Configure Distributed Training Frameworks
For large-scale models, distributed training across multiple GPUs or even multiple nodes is necessary. Install frameworks like Horovod or Dask for efficient distributed training.

Install Horovod:

bash
Copy code
pip install horovod
Configure Horovod with TensorFlow or PyTorch:

TensorFlow:
bash
Copy code
horovodrun -np 4 -H localhost:4 python train.py
PyTorch:
bash
Copy code
horovodrun -np 4 -H localhost:4 python train.py
Install Dask for distributed computing:

bash
Copy code
pip install dask distributed
Run a distributed job with Dask:

bash
Copy code
from dask.distributed import Client
client = Client()
