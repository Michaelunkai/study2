    "This tutorial walks you through creating AI-generated art using the Stable Diffusion model in PyTorch. The provided code initializes by checking if a GPU is available using CUDA. If CUDA is available, the model leverages GPU acceleration for faster processing; otherwise, it defaults to CPU. The Stable Diffusion model `runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5` is loaded, and the image is generated based on a text prompt. The generated image is then saved to a specified location on your file system. The code also includes error handling to manage any issues that may arise during execution.\n",
