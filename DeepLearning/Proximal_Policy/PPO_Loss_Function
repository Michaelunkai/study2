PPO Loss Function
PPO uses the following loss function:

where 
𝑟

​
 (θ) is the ratio of the new policy to the old policy, 
𝐴

  is the advantage function, and 
𝜖
ϵ is a hyperparameter (usually around 0.2). This function aims to maximize the probability of advantageous actions while ensuring the policy doesn't change more than approximately 20%.
