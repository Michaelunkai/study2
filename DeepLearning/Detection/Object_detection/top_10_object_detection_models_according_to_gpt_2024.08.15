Here are the top 10 object detection models, ranked best to worst as of today:

1. **YOLOv8** - State-of-the-art speed and accuracy for real-time object detection.
2. **YOLOv7** - Prior best real-time detector, balancing speed and accuracy.
3. **YOLOv5** - Widely used, very fast, and offers good accuracy.
4. **DETR (DEtection TRansformers)** - Transformer-based, strong at handling complex scenes.
5. **EfficientDet** - Efficient architecture with high accuracy and speed.
6. **Faster R-CNN** - High accuracy, especially in handling smaller objects, but slower.
7. **CenterNet** - Good balance between speed and accuracy with a keypoint-based approach.
8. **RetinaNet** - Known for its Focal Loss, strong in detecting small objects.
9. **SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector)** - Fast but generally less accurate compared to newer models.
10. **YOLOv4** - Reliable and fast, but superseded by newer YOLO versions.

This ranking is based on their current usage, performance, and popularity in real-world applications.
