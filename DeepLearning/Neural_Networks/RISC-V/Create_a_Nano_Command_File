 Create a Nano Command File
For convenience, you can create a script to automate the build and run process. Hereâ€™s an example of a nano command file to streamline the setup.

 
 
nano setup_risc_analysis. 
Paste the following script into the nano editor:

 
 
#!/bin/ 

# Update and upgrade system packages
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install necessary dependencies
sudo apt install -y build-essential git cmake

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain.git
cd riscv-gnu-toolchain

# Build the project
./configure --prefix=/opt/riscv
make

# Add the toolchain to the PATH
export PATH=/opt/riscv/bin:$PATH

# Verify installation
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc --version
Save and exit the nano editor by pressing CTRL+X, then Y, and Enter.



Make the Script Executable
Make the script executable and run it.

 
 
chmod +x setup_risc_analysis. 
./setup_risc_analysis.
