Keyboard Shortcuts to Toggle Line Comment
Windows/Linux:
Shortcut: Ctrl + /
macOS:
Shortcut: Command + /


Certainly! In Visual Studio Code (VS Code), managing comments efficiently can significantly enhance your coding workflow. Here's a comprehensive guide to:

1. **Removing `#` from a line (Uncommenting)**
2. **Adding `#` to multiple lines**
3. **Removing `#` from multiple lines**

### **1. Removing `#` from the Current Line (Uncommenting)**

VS Code uses the same shortcut to **toggle** comments, meaning it can both add (`#`) and remove (`#`) comments based on the current state of the line.

#### **Shortcut:**
- **Windows/Linux:** `Ctrl + /`
- **macOS:** `Command + /`

#### **How to Uncomment:**
1. **Single Line:**
   - Place your cursor on the commented line.
   - Press `Ctrl + /` (Windows/Linux) or `Command + /` (macOS).
   - The `#` will be removed, uncommenting the line.

2. **Multiple Lines:**
   - Select the commented lines.
   - Press `Ctrl + /` or `Command + /`.
   - All `#` symbols will be removed from the beginning of each selected line.

#### **Example:**

**Before Uncommenting:**
  
# print("Hello, World!")

**After Pressing `Ctrl + /` or `Command + /`:**
  
print("Hello, World!")

### **2. Adding `#` to Multiple Lines (Commenting)**

You can comment multiple lines simultaneously using the same toggle shortcut.

#### **Shortcut:**
- **Windows/Linux:** `Ctrl + /`
- **macOS:** `Command + /`

#### **How to Comment Multiple Lines:**
1. **Select the Lines:**
   - Click and drag to highlight the lines you want to comment.
   - Alternatively, place the cursor at the start of the first line, hold `Shift`, and use the arrow keys to select additional lines.

2. **Apply the Shortcut:**
   - Press `Ctrl + /` (Windows/Linux) or `Command + /` (macOS).
   - A `#` will be added to the beginning of each selected line, commenting them out.

#### **Example:**

**Before Commenting:**
  
print("Line 1")
print("Line 2")
print("Line 3")

**After Pressing `Ctrl + /` or `Command + /`:**
  
# print("Line 1")
# print("Line 2")
# print("Line 3")

### **3. Removing `#` from All Selected Lines (Uncommenting Multiple Lines)**

Uncommenting multiple lines is just as straightforward as commenting them.

#### **Shortcut:**
- **Windows/Linux:** `Ctrl + /`
- **macOS:** `Command + /`

#### **How to Uncomment Multiple Lines:**
1. **Select the Commented Lines:**
   - Highlight all the lines from which you want to remove the `#`.

2. **Apply the Shortcut:**
   - Press `Ctrl + /` (Windows/Linux) or `Command + /` (macOS).
   - The `#` will be removed from the beginning of each selected line, uncommenting them.

#### **Example:**

**Before Uncommenting:**
  
# print("Line 1")
# print("Line 2")
# print("Line 3")

**After Pressing `Ctrl + /` or `Command + /`:**
  
print("Line 1")
print("Line 2")
print("Line 3")

### **Customizing Shortcuts (Optional)**

If you prefer separate shortcuts for commenting and uncommenting (rather than a toggle), you can customize your keybindings:

1. **Open Keyboard Shortcuts:**
   - Press `Ctrl + K` then `Ctrl + S` (Windows/Linux) or `Command + K` then `Command + S` (macOS).
   - Alternatively, go to **File > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts**.

2. **Add Specific Shortcuts:**
   - **Comment Lines:**
     - Search for `Add Line Comment`.
     - Click the **pencil icon** next to it.
     - Press your desired key combination (e.g., `Ctrl + Shift + C`).
     - Press `Enter` to confirm.
   
   - **Uncomment Lines:**
     - Search for `Remove Line Comment`.
     - Click the **pencil icon** next to it.
     - Press your desired key combination (e.g., `Ctrl + Shift + U`).
     - Press `Enter` to confirm.

3. **Save and Test:**
   - Ensure your new shortcuts donâ€™t conflict with existing ones.
   - Test them on single and multiple lines to confirm they work as intended.

> **Note:** Customizing shortcuts allows for more granular control but requires managing potential keybinding conflicts.

### **Additional Tips**

- **Block Comments:**
  - For languages that support block comments, you can use:
    - **Windows/Linux:** `Shift + Alt + A`
    - **macOS:** `Shift + Option + A`
  - This is useful for commenting out large blocks of code.

- **Language Specificity:**
  - Ensure that the file type you're working with supports `#` for comments (e.g., Python, Bash, Ruby).
  - VS Code automatically applies the correct comment syntax based on the file type.

- **Using Extensions:**
  - Extensions like **Better Comments** can provide enhanced commenting features, such as categorizing comments or adding color codes.

### **Conclusion**

VS Code's **Toggle Line Comment** (`Ctrl + /` or `Command + /`) is a versatile shortcut that efficiently handles both adding and removing `#` comments for single or multiple lines. By selecting the desired lines and applying the shortcut, you can quickly manage your code's commented state without manually adding or deleting `#` symbols.

If you require more specialized behavior, such as distinct shortcuts for commenting and uncommenting, VS Code allows you to customize keybindings to fit your workflow seamlessly.
