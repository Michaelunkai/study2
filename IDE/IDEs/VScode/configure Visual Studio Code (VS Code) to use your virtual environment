To configure Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to use your virtual environment located at `C:\backup\windowsapps\venv`, follow these steps:

1. **Open VS Code**.
2. **Open the Command Palette** by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P`.
3. Type **"Python: Select Interpreter"** and select it.
4. You will see a list of available Python interpreters. Choose the interpreter from your virtual environment located at:
   ```
   C:\backup\windowsapps\venv\Scripts\python.exe
   ```
5. **Set up the Python Path**:
   - Go to the **settings** by clicking on the gear icon in the bottom left and then **"Settings"**.
   - Search for `python.pythonPath` and set it to:
     ```
     C:\\backup\\windowsapps\\venv\\Scripts\\python.exe
     ```
6. **Activate Virtual Environment in Terminal**:
   - Open the **integrated terminal** in VS Code (`Ctrl + `) and run:
     ```
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

Now, VS Code should use your virtual environment for running Python scripts and provide IntelliSense based on the packages installed in your virtual environment.
