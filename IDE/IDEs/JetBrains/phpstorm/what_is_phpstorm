### 6. **Version Control Integration**
   PhpStorm integrates seamlessly with version control systems (VCS) such as Git, GitHub, Mercurial, and Subversion. It offers:
   - **Commit and Push**: Users can perform all standard version control tasks, such as committing, pushing, and pulling changes, directly from the IDE.
   - **Conflict Resolution**: PhpStorm helps manage and resolve code conflicts efficiently by providing clear visual cues and tools for merging code.

### 7. **Unit Testing and Test Frameworks**
   PhpStorm supports **PHPUnit**, **Behat**, **PHPSpec**, and other popular testing frameworks, allowing developers to write and execute unit tests directly from the IDE. Key testing features include:
   - **Test Runner**: PhpStorm provides a visual test runner, which displays the progress and results of the tests, including failures and errors.
   - **Code Coverage**: PhpStorm can generate code coverage reports, showing how much of your code is covered by tests.

### 8. **Code Quality Tools**
   PhpStorm offers a range of tools to help maintain high code quality:
   - **Code Inspections**: PhpStorm analyzes the code for errors and possible improvements, warning about unused variables, deprecated functions, and potential performance issues.
   - **Code Sniffer Integration**: PhpStorm integrates with tools like PHP CodeSniffer and PHPMD (PHP Mess Detector) to ensure adherence to coding standards.

### 9. **Deployment Tools**
   PhpStorm allows seamless deployment of applications:
   - **FTP/SFTP Deployment**: PhpStorm can automatically upload files to remote servers via FTP, SFTP, or FTPS.
   - **SSH Integration**: It supports SSH terminal access, allowing users to work with remote servers directly from the IDE.
