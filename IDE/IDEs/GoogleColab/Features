Free Access to GPUs and TPUs: Google Colab provides free access to powerful hardware accelerators such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which can significantly speed up computational tasks.

Jupyter Notebook Interface: Colab uses the familiar Jupyter Notebook interface, which is widely used in data science and machine learning. This interface allows users to combine code, text, and visualizations in a single document, making it easy to document and share analyses.

Collaboration: Colab allows multiple users to collaborate on the same notebook simultaneously. Users can share notebooks with others, enabling collaborative work in real-time.

Pre-installed Libraries: Many popular Python libraries for data science and machine learning (such as NumPy, pandas, TensorFlow, and PyTorch) are pre-installed in Colab, saving users the time and effort required to set up their environments.

Integration with Google Drive: Users can save and access their Colab notebooks directly from Google Drive, facilitating easy storage and sharing of work.

Free and Pro Versions: While the basic version of Colab is free, Google also offers Colab Pro and Colab Pro+ subscriptions, which provide enhanced access to more powerful GPUs and longer runtime sessions.
