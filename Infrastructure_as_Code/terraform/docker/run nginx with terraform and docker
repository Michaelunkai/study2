install docker and terraform


mkdir learn-terraform-docker-container && cd learn-terraform-docker-container




In the working directory, create a file called main.tf and paste the following Terraform configuration into it:



terraform {
  required_providers {
    docker = {
      source  = "kreuzwerker/docker"
      version = "~> 3.0.1"
    }
  }
}

provider "docker" {}

resource "docker_image" "nginx" {
  name         = "nginx"
  keep_locally = false
}

resource "docker_container" "nginx" {
  image = docker_image.nginx.image_id
  name  = "tutorial"

  ports {
    internal = 80
    external = 8000
  }
}




Initialize the project, which downloads a plugin called a provider that lets Terraform interact with Docker.

 terraform init

Provision the NGINX server container with apply. When Terraform asks you to confirm type yes and press ENTER.

 terraform apply


To stop the container, run terraform destroy.

 terraform destroy


You've now provisioned and destroyed an NGINX webserver with Terraform.
