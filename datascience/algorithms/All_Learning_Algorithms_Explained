Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used to model the relationship between a continuous target variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the data. It aims to find the best regression line by minimizing the sum of squares of the distances between the data points and the regression line.

Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Support Vector Machine is a supervised learning algorithm mainly used for classification tasks, but it can also be used for regression. SVM distinguishes classes by drawing a decision boundary, which is optimized by maximizing the distance to the nearest data points (support vectors). It is particularly effective in cases where the number of dimensions exceeds the number of samples.

Naive Bayes
Naive Bayes is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It assumes that features are independent of each other (the "naive" assumption) and uses Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of a class given a set of feature values. This makes Naive Bayes very fast, although less accurate than more complex algorithms.

Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for binary classification problems. It is based on the logistic function (or sigmoid function) to map any real-valued number to a value between 0 and 1. It is effective for many binary classification tasks, such as predicting customer churn, spam email detection, and ad click predictions.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
K-Nearest Neighbors is a supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It determines the value of a data point based on the majority class or the mean value of the k-nearest neighbors. KNN is simple and easy to interpret but can be slow and memory-intensive for large datasets.

Decision Trees
Decision Trees work by iteratively asking questions to partition the data. They are easy to visualize and understand but are prone to overfitting. Decision trees do not require normalization or scaling of features and can handle mixed data types. However, they often need to be combined (ensembled) to generalize well.

Random Forest
Random Forest is an ensemble algorithm that uses multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. It uses bagging (bootstrap aggregating) and feature randomness to create uncorrelated trees, which vote on the final classification or regression result. Random Forests are highly accurate and do not require normalization but are not ideal for high-dimensional data.

Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT)
Gradient Boosted Decision Trees is an ensemble algorithm that combines individual decision trees using boosting methods. Each tree corrects the errors of the previous ones, making GBDT highly accurate for both classification and regression tasks. It does not require bootstrap sampling and is effective but requires careful tuning to prevent overfitting.

K-Means Clustering
K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that partitions data into k clusters based on similarities. It iteratively updates cluster centroids and assigns data points to the nearest centroid until convergence. K-Means is fast and easy to interpret but requires the number of clusters to be predefined and is not suitable for non-linear structures.

DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm that can find arbitrarily shaped clusters and detect outliers. It classifies points as core points, border points, or outliers based on the density of points in their neighborhood. DBSCAN does not require the number of clusters to be predefined and is robust to outliers.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Principal Component Analysis is a dimensionality reduction algorithm that derives new features (principal components) from existing ones while retaining as much variance as possible. PCA is an unsupervised learning algorithm commonly used as a pre-processing step for supervised learning algorithms. It reduces the number of features while maintaining the significant variance of the original dataset.
