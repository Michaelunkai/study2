Introduction to Random Forests
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method for classification, regression, and other tasks. It operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.

Key Concepts:

Decision Trees: These are the building blocks of a Random Forest. A decision tree is a model that splits the data into branches to form a tree-like structure. Each node represents a feature, each branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf represents an outcome.

Ensemble Method: Random Forest is an ensemble method, which means it combines multiple models to improve performance. The idea is to aggregate the predictions of multiple decision trees to obtain a more robust and accurate prediction.

Randomness: Random Forest introduces randomness in two ways:

Bootstrapping: Each tree is trained on a random subset of the data, selected with replacement.
Feature Selection: At each split in the decision tree, a random subset of features is considered.
Advantages:

Reduces overfitting by averaging multiple trees.
Handles large datasets with higher dimensionality.
Provides an estimate of feature importance.
Disadvantages:

Can be computationally intensive.
Less interpretable compared to a single decision tree.
