When you first run Ghidra, it will prompt you to set up a new project:

Open Ghidra (ghidra in terminal or via application menu).
Select New Project.
Choose the project type (non-shared for local projects).
Select the directory and name for your project.
Once the project is created, you can import binaries for analysis.
