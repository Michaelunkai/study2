Ghidra is a software reverse engineering (SRE) framework developed by the National Security Agency (NSA) of the United States. It was publicly released in 2019 as free and open-source software. Ghidra provides tools for analyzing compiled code on various platforms, enabling users to understand the functionality and structure of the software.
Key features of Ghidra include:
1. Multi-platform Support: Ghidra runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
2. Graphical User Interface (GUI): It offers a user-friendly GUI to facilitate analysis.
3. Decompiler: Ghidra includes a decompiler that translates machine code back into a higher-level programming language, which aids in understanding the code's logic.
4. Scripting: Users can write scripts in Python or Java to automate tasks and extend functionality.
5. Collaboration: Ghidra supports collaborative analysis, allowing multiple users to work on the same project simultaneously.
Ghidra is widely used by cybersecurity professionals, researchers, and software engineers to analyze malware, discover vulnerabilities, and understand legacy code.
