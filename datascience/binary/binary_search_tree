A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a type of data structure used in computer science to store and manage data. Imagine you have a collection of numbers and you want to organize them in a way that makes it easy to search, add, and delete numbers. A BST does this by arranging the numbers in a tree-like structure. Here’s a simple and detailed explanation:

Key Characteristics of a Binary Search Tree
Node: Each element in the tree is called a node. A node contains a value (also called a key) and may have two children.
Root: The top node of the tree.
Children: Nodes that come from another node (parent node).
Left Child: The left child contains values less than the parent node.
Right Child: The right child contains values greater than the parent node.
How it Works
Starting with the Root: The first number you put in the tree becomes the root.
Inserting a Number:
Compare the number to the root.
If the number is smaller, go to the left child.
If the number is larger, go to the right child.
Repeat this process until you find an empty spot, and place the number there.
Searching for a Number:
Start at the root.
Compare the number to the root.
If it matches, you found the number.
If it’s smaller, go to the left child.
If it’s larger, go to the right child.
Repeat until you find the number or reach a dead end (the number isn’t in the tree).
Example
Let's build a Binary Search Tree with the numbers: 50, 30, 70, 20, 40, 60, 80.

Start with 50:

50 becomes the root.
 
   50
Add 30:

30 is less than 50, so it goes to the left.
 
   50
  /
 30
Add 70:

70 is greater than 50, so it goes to the right.
 
   50
  /  \
 30   70
Add 20:

20 is less than 50, go left to 30.
20 is less than 30, so it goes to the left of 30.
 
   50
  /  \
 30   70
/
20
Add 40:

40 is less than 50, go left to 30.
40 is greater than 30, so it goes to the right of 30.
 
   50
  /  \
 30   70
/ \
20  40
Add 60:

60 is greater than 50, go right to 70.
60 is less than 70, so it goes to the left of 70.
 
   50
  /  \
 30   70
/ \   /
20  40 60
Add 80:

80 is greater than 50, go right to 70.
80 is greater than 70, so it goes to the right of 70.
 
   50
  /  \
 30   70
/ \   / \
20  40 60 80
Benefits of a Binary Search Tree
Efficient Searching: You can quickly find a number by following the left or right child based on comparisons.
Order: The in-order traversal of a BST (visiting nodes from the leftmost to the rightmost) gives you the numbers in ascending order.
Flexibility: BSTs can handle insertions and deletions while maintaining order.
Real-World Analogy
Think of a BST like a family tree, but instead of people, you have numbers. The "parent" number always has two "children" (left and right) who follow the rule: the left child is smaller, and the right child is larger. This organization helps you quickly find any number by starting at the top (the root) and making decisions to go left or right based on comparisons.
