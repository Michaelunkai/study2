Rules for Subtracting Binary Numbers
Subtracting 0 from 0:

0 - 0 = 0
Subtracting 1 from 0:

0 - 1 = 1, and you borrow 1 from the next higher bit.
This is because in binary, 0 - 1 requires borrowing, similar to decimal subtraction where you borrow from the next column.
Subtracting 0 from 1:

1 - 0 = 1
Subtracting 1 from 1:

1 - 1 = 0
Borrowing in Binary Subtraction:
When borrowing in binary, you take 1 from the next higher bit. This is equivalent to borrowing 10 (binary) or 2 (decimal).
Example:
Let's subtract 1011 (11 in decimal) and 110 (6 in decimal).

Align the numbers:

 
 
  1011
- 0110
Subtract from right to left:

Rightmost column: 1 - 0 = 1
Next column: 1 - 1 = 0
Next column: 0 - 1 (need to borrow from the next column)
Borrow 1 from the next column (10 - 1 = 1)
After borrowing, the column becomes 10 - 1 = 1
Adjust the borrowed column: 1 - 1 = 0
Leftmost column: 1 (since we borrowed from this column earlier, it becomes 0 after adjustment)
Write down the result:

 
 
  1011
- 0110
------
  0101
Final Answer:
1011 - 0110 = 0101
Summary of Subtraction Rules:
0 - 0 = 0
1 - 0 = 1
1 - 1 = 0
0 - 1 = 1 (with borrowing)
Another Example:
Let's subtract 10010 (18 in decimal) and 1011 (11 in decimal).

Align the numbers:

diff
 
  10010
-  1011
Subtract from right to left:

Rightmost column: 0 - 1 (need to borrow)
Borrow from next column (10 - 1 = 1)
After borrowing, the column becomes 10 - 1 = 1
Next column: 0 - 1 (need to borrow)
Borrow from next column (10 - 1 = 1)
After borrowing, the column becomes 10 - 1 = 1
Next column: 1 - 0 = 1
Next column: 0 - 1 (need to borrow)
Borrow from next column (10 - 1 = 1)
After borrowing, the column becomes 10 - 1 = 1
Leftmost column: 1 - 0 = 1
Write down the result:

 
 
  10010
-  1011
------
  01111
Final Answer:
10010 - 1011 = 01111
By following these rules and steps, you can accurately subtract binary numbers.
