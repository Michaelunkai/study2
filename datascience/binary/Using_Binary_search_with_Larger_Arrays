Using Binary Search with Larger Arrays
Create a New Python File: Let's start fresh with a new file.

 
 
nano large_binary_search.py
Write the Updated Binary Search Code: Copy the following code into the file. This code will do a binary search on a big array.

 
 
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    
    return -1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    arr = list(range(1000000))  # Creates a list of numbers from 0 to 999999
    target = 999999
    
    result = binary_search(arr, target)
    
    if result != -1:
        print("Element found at index:", str(result))
    else:
        print("Element not found")
Save and Close the File: In nano, press Ctrl + X, then Y to confirm, and Enter to save.

Step 23: Running the Updated Script
Run the Python Script:
 
 
 3 large_binary_search.py
You should see the output:

mathematica
 
Element found at index: 999999
Step 24: Explaining the Code
Creating a Big Array:

arr = list(range(1000000)): This line creates a big list of numbers from 0 to 999999. Imagine writing all the numbers from 0 to 999999 on paper â€“ this list does that for you.
Setting the Target:

target = 999999: We want to find the number 999999 in our big list.
Binary Search Function:

We already know how this works from before. It searches for our target number quickly by dividing the list in half each time.
Printing the Result:

if result != -1: This checks if we found the number.
print("Element found at index:", str(result)): If we found it, we print where it is.
else: If we didn't find it, we print that it's not found.
Step 25: Measuring Performance with Large Arrays
Using Time Module to Measure Execution Time:

 
 
import time

def measure_time(func, *args):
    start_time = time.time()
    result = func(*args)
    end_time = time.time()
    return result, end_time - start_time

if __name__ == "__main__":
    arr = list(range(1000000))
    target = 999999

    # Measure time for binary search
    result, time_taken = measure_time(binary_search, arr, target)
    
    if result != -1:
        print("Element found at index:", str(result), "Time:", time_taken)
    else:
        print("Element not found")
Save and Close the File: In nano, press Ctrl + X, then Y to confirm, and Enter to save.

Step 26: Running the Performance Measurement Script
Run the Python Script:
 
 
 3 large_binary_search.py
You should see output similar to:

less
 
Element found at index: 999999 Time: 0.00001239776611328125
Step 27: Explaining the Performance Measurement Code
Importing the Time Module:

import time: This lets us keep track of how long things take.
Measure Time Function:

measure_time(func, *args): This function measures how long another function takes to run.
start_time = time.time(): This remembers the time right before the function starts.
result = func(*args): This runs the function we want to measure.
end_time = time.time(): This remembers the time right after the function finishes.
return result, end_time - start_time: This gives us the result and how long it took.
Using the Measure Time Function:

We use measure_time to see how long binary_search takes to find our target.
Printing the Result and Time:

print("Element found at index:", str(result), "Time:", time_taken): This prints where the number was found and how long it took.

Step-by-Step Code with Detailed Comments
Create a New Python File: Let's create a new file where we'll write our binary search code.

 
 
nano detailed_binary_search.py
Write the Binary Search Code with Detailed Comments: Copy the following code into the file.

 
 
# Import the time module to measure execution time

    # Continue searching while the left pointer is less than or equal to the right pointer
    while left <= right:
        # Find the middle index of the current search range
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        
        # If the middle element is the target, return the index
        if arr[mid] == target:

Running the Script
Run the Python Script:
 
 
 3 detailed_binary_search.py
You should see output similar to:

less
 
Element found at index: 999999 Time: 0.00001239776611328125
Explanation of the Code
Importing the Time Module:

 
 
import time  # This line imports the time module, which allows us to measure how long things take.
Binary Search Function:

 
 
def binary_search(arr, target):  # This line defines our binary search function.
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1  # We start with left at 0 and right at the end of the array.
    
    while left <= right:  # This loop continues as long as the left pointer is not past the right pointer.
        mid = (left + right) // 2  # This line finds the middle index of our current search range.
        
        if arr[mid] == target:  # If the middle element is the target, we found it.
            return mid  # Return the index of the middle element.
        elif arr[mid] < target:  # If the middle element is less than the target, search the right half.
            left = mid + 1  # Move the left pointer to mid + 1.
        else:  # If the middle element is greater than the target, search the left half.
            right = mid - 1  # Move the right pointer to mid - 1.
    
    return -1  # If we don't find the target, return -1 to indicate it's not in the array.
Measure Time Function:

 
 
def measure_time(func, *args):  # This line defines a function to measure how long another function takes to run.
    start_time = time.time()  # Record the start time before running the function.
    result = func(*args)  # Call the function with the provided arguments and store the result.
    end_time = time.time()  # Record the end time after the function finishes.
    return result, end_time - start_time  # Return the result and the time it took to run.
Main Block:

 
 
if __name__ == "__main__":  # This line checks if the script is being run directly (not imported).
    arr = list(range(1000000))  # Create a list of numbers from 0 to 999999.
    target = 999999  # Set the target number we want to find in the array.

    result, time_taken = measure_time(binary_search, arr, target)  # Measure the time taken to find the target.
    
    if result != -1:  # If the target is found, print the index and time taken.
        print("Element found at index:", str(result), "Time:", time_taken)
    else:  # If the target is not found, print a message saying so.
        print("Element not found")
