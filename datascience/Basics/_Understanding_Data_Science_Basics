 Understanding Data Science Basics
What is Data Science?
Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data.

Key Concepts:
Data: Raw facts and figures that need processing.
Information: Processed data that is meaningful.
Knowledge: Insights derived from information.
The Data Science Process:
Define the Problem: Clearly understand and define the problem you're trying to solve.
Data Collection: Gather the necessary data from various sources.
Data Cleaning: Remove any inconsistencies or errors in the data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the data to understand patterns and relationships.
Modeling: Use algorithms to build models based on the data.
Evaluation: Assess the performance of the models.
Deployment: Implement the model in a real-world environment.
Monitoring and Maintenance: Continuously monitor the model's performance and make necessary adjustments.
Types of Data:
Structured Data: Organized data, often in tabular form (e.g., databases, spreadsheets).
Unstructured Data: Unorganized data (e.g., text, images, videos).
Semi-Structured Data: Partially organized data (e.g., JSON, XML files).
Common Data Science Tools:
Python/R: Programming languages commonly used in data science.
Jupyter Notebooks: An open-source web application for creating and sharing documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
Pandas: A library for data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: A library for numerical computing.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: Libraries for data visualization.
Scikit-learn: A library for machine learning.
Key Data Science Algorithms:
Regression: Predicting continuous values.
Classification: Predicting categorical values.
Clustering: Grouping similar data points together.
Association Rule Learning: Discovering interesting relationships between variables.
Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of variables under consideration.
