MongoDB Atlas is a fully managed cloud database service that allows you to deploy, operate, and scale MongoDB databases. It provides a global cloud database service that runs on major cloud providers such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. MongoDB Atlas automates the time-consuming tasks of database management, such as infrastructure provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups. This allows developers to focus on building their applications rather than managing the database infrastructure.

Key features of MongoDB Atlas include:

- **Global Clusters**: Easily deploy clusters across multiple regions and cloud providers to ensure high availability and low latency.
- **Automated Backups**: Regular backups with point-in-time recovery.
- **Security**: Features like encryption at rest, network isolation, and fine-grained access controls.
- **Scalability**: Seamlessly scale out or scale up your database to meet your application's needs.
- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Built-in monitoring and alerting tools to keep track of database performance and issues.
- **Data Tooling**: Integration with various MongoDB tools like Atlas Search, Data Lake, and Real-Time Analytics.

MongoDB Atlas is often chosen by organizations that want the flexibility and power of MongoDB without the operational overhead of managing the database infrastructure themselves.
