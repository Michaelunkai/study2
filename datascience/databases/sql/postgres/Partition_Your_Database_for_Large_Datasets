Partition Your Database for Large Datasets
Partitioning splits your data into smaller, more manageable chunks.

Steps:

Use vertical partitioning for columns that are often queried together:
 
 
CREATE TABLE employee_hot (id INT, name VARCHAR(100), salary DECIMAL);
For time-series data or other large datasets, use horizontal partitioning:
 
 
CREATE TABLE employee_partition_2024 (LIKE employee);
