Use Covering Indexes to Avoid Table Scans
Covering indexes include all the columns needed for a query, reducing the need to scan the main table.

Steps:

Drop the existing index if needed and create a covering index for the query:
 
 
DROP INDEX idx_employee_name;
CREATE INDEX idx_employee_name_salary
ON employee (name, salary);
Run the query and observe the index-only scan:
 
 
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT salary FROM employee WHERE name = 'John';
