 Analyze Query Execution Plan
To see how PostgreSQL executes a query and understand where you can improve performance, use the EXPLAIN command.

Steps:

Run the EXPLAIN ANALYZE command to see the query execution details.
Example:

 
 
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT e1.employee_id, e1.employee_name, e1.salary
FROM employee e1
WHERE e1.salary > (
  SELECT AVG(e2.salary)
  FROM employee e2
  WHERE e2.department_id = e1.department_id
);
This will give you detailed information on query execution time, indexes used, and more.
