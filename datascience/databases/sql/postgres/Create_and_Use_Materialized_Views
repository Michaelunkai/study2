Create and Use Materialized Views
Materialized views store the results of queries on disk, making subsequent queries faster.

Steps:

Create a materialized view for frequently queried, complex data:
 
 
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW employee_salaries AS
SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employee
GROUP BY department_id;
Refresh the materialized view periodically:
 
 
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW employee_salaries;
