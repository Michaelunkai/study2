Sure, here's the updated step-by-step guide with the specified command for installing Litestream:

### Step 1: Update and Upgrade Your System

First, update your package lists and upgrade your existing packages.

``` 
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### Step 2: Install SQLite

If you don't have SQLite installed, you can install it using the following command:

``` 
sudo apt install  ite3
```

### Step 3: Download and Install Litestream

Use the following command to download and install Litestream:

``` 
wget https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream/releases/download/v0.3.13/litestream-v0.3.13-linux-amd64.deb && sudo dpkg -i litestream-v0.3.13-linux-amd64.deb && litestream version
```

### Step 4: Configure Litestream

1. **Create a configuration file for Litestream:**

``` 
sudo nano /etc/litestream.yml
```

2. **Add the following content to configure Litestream to replicate your SQLite database. Replace the placeholder values with your actual paths and S3 bucket information if you're using S3 for replication:**

``` 
dbs:
  - path: /path/to/your/database.db
    replicas:
      - url: s3://your-s3-bucket/path/to/replica
        access-key-id: YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
        secret-access-key: YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
        region: YOUR_AWS_REGION
```

**Save and exit** the file (Ctrl + X, then Y, then Enter).

### Step 5: Start Litestream

You can start Litestream manually or set it up as a service.

**To start manually:**

``` 
sudo litestream replicate -config /etc/litestream.yml
```

**To set up as a systemd service:**

1. **Create a new systemd service file:**

``` 
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/litestream.service
```

2. **Add the following content to the service file:**

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Litestream
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/litestream replicate -config /etc/litestream.yml
Restart=on-failure
User=root
Group=root

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

3. **Save and exit** the file (Ctrl + X, then Y, then Enter).

4. **Reload the systemd daemon to recognize the new service:**

``` 
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

5. **Enable the service to start on boot:**

``` 
sudo systemctl enable litestream
```

6. **Start the service:**

``` 
sudo systemctl start litestream
```

### Step 6: Verify Litestream Replication

Check the status of the Litestream service to ensure it's running correctly:

``` 
sudo systemctl status litestream
```

You should see an active status. To check the logs for any errors or additional information:

``` 
sudo journalctl -u litestream
```

### Step 7: Testing Replication

1. **Create or modify your SQLite database to test replication:**

``` 
 ite3 /path/to/your/database.db "CREATE TABLE test (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, value TEXT);"
```

2. **Insert some data:**

``` 
 ite3 /path/to/your/database.db "INSERT INTO test (value) VALUES ('hello world');"
```

3. **Check if the data is being replicated by accessing your S3 bucket or the configured replica destination.**

That's it! You've set up Litestream for SQLite replication on Ubuntu. This configuration will ensure that your SQLite database is continuously backed up to the specified destination, providing redundancy and reliability.
