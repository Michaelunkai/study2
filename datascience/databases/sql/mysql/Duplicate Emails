### 182. Duplicate Emails

Write a solution to report all the duplicate emails. Note that it's guaranteed that the email field is not NULL.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example:

#### Example 1:
```
Input:
Person table:
+----+---------+
| id | email   |
+----+---------+
| 1  | a@b.com |
| 2  | c@d.com |
| 3  | a@b.com |
+----+---------+

Output:
+---------+
| Email   |
+---------+
| a@b.com |
+---------+

Explanation: a@b.com is repeated two times.
```

Here is the SQL solution for the problem:

```sql
SELECT email
FROM Person
GROUP BY email
HAVING COUNT(email) > 1;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Group By Email**: We group the records by the email column.
2. **Count Emails**: We use the `COUNT` function to count the occurrences of each email.
3. **Filter Duplicates**: We use the `HAVING` clause to filter out emails that appear more than once.

This query identifies all duplicate emails in the `Person` table by counting the occurrences of each email and filtering out those that appear more than once.
