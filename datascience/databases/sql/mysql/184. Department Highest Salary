184. Department Highest Salary
Write a SQL query to find employees who have the highest salary in each of the departments.

Return the result table in any order.

Example 1:
Input:
Employee table:
| id | name  | salary | departmentId |
|----|-------|--------|--------------|
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 1            |
| 2  | Jim   | 90000  | 1            |
| 3  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 4  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 5  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |

Department table:
| id | name  |
|----|-------|
| 1  | IT    |
| 2  | Sales |

Output:
| Department | Employee | Salary |
|------------|----------|--------|
| IT         | Jim      | 90000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
Here is the correct SQL solution for the problem:

SELECT d.name AS Department, e.name AS Employee, e.salary AS Salary
FROM Employee e
JOIN Department d ON e.departmentId = d.id
WHERE (e.salary, e.departmentId) IN (
    SELECT MAX(salary), departmentId
    FROM Employee
    GROUP BY departmentId
);
Explanation:
INNER JOIN: We perform an INNER JOIN between the Employee table and the Department table on the departmentId column from Employee and the id column from Department.
Subquery for MAX Salary: The subquery finds the maximum salary for each department by grouping employees by their departmentId and selecting the maximum salary in each group.
Filtering by Max Salary: The outer query selects the department name, employee name, and salary where the employee's salary and department match the results from the subquery.
