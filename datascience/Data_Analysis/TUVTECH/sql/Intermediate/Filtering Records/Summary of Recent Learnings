### Summary of Recent Learnings

In your last session, you worked on **Filtering Records** in Chapter 2 of the *Intermediate SQL* course. Here's a concise recap of the key concepts you covered:

#### Key Learnings:
1. **Filtering Data with the WHERE Clause**:
   - The `WHERE` clause is fundamental for narrowing down query results based on specific conditions, improving data analysis precision.

2. **Numerical Data Filters**:
   - Utilized comparison operators for numerical filtering:
     - `>`: Greater than a specified value.
     - `<`: Less than a specified value.
     - `=`: Exact matches.
     - `>=` and `<=`: Inclusive comparisons.
     - `<>`: Not equal to a specific value.

3. **Textual Data Filters**:
   - Applied the `WHERE` clause to string data using single quotes:
     ```sql
     SELECT COUNT(language) AS count_spanish
     FROM films
     WHERE language = 'Spanish';
     ```

4. **Clause Order**:
   - Highlighted the importance of clause order in queries, especially when combining `WHERE` and `LIMIT`.

#### Outcome:
This lesson strengthened your ability to craft precise SQL queries, enabling more targeted and relevant data analysis.

#### Next Steps:
The upcoming lesson will focus on **sorting and grouping data** in SQL. This will allow you to organize and present your query results more effectively, enhancing your analytical capabilities.
