### 6. Creating a Scatter Plot

**Question:**
Using the `netflix_movies_col_subset` DataFrame, create a scatter plot with `release_year` on the x-axis and `duration` on the y-axis. Add the title "Movie Duration by Year of Release" and display the plot.

**Answer (Code):**
```python
# Step 1: Import matplotlib.pyplot (if not already imported)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Step 2: Create a figure and set the figure size
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))

# Step 3: Create a scatter plot with release_year on x-axis and duration on y-axis
plt.scatter(netflix_movies_col_subset['release_year'], netflix_movies_col_subset['duration'])

# Step 4: Add a title to the plot
plt.title("Movie Duration by Year of Release")

# Step 5: Show the plot
plt.show()
``` 

**Expected Output:**
A scatter plot displaying individual movies with their `release_year` on the x-axis and `duration` on the y-axis. The title "Movie Duration by Year of Release" will appear above the plot.

**Notes:**
- Ensure `netflix_movies_col_subset` is properly created and contains the columns `release_year` and `duration`.
- The `figsize=(12, 8)` increases the size of the plot for better visibility.
