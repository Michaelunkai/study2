Setting up and using Bubble on Ubuntu involves creating an account and using the web-based platform. Since Bubble is a web application, you don’t need to install any software on your Ubuntu system. Here’s a step-by-step guide:
Step 1: Create a Bubble Account
1. Open Your Web Browser: Launch any web browser on your Ubuntu system (e.g., Firefox, Chrome).
2. Visit Bubble’s Website: Go to https://bubble.io.
3. Sign Up: Click on the “Get Started” or “Sign Up” button. Fill in your details to create a new account.
Step 2: Create a New Project
1. Login: Once you have signed up, log in to your Bubble account.
2. New Application: Click on the “New App” button to create a new project.
3. App Name: Enter a name for your application and select the appropriate template if needed. You can start with a blank template or use one of Bubble’s predefined templates.
Step 3: Designing Your Application
1. Visual Editor: After creating your app, you will be taken to the Bubble editor. Here, you can start designing your application's user interface.
   - Elements: Drag and drop UI elements (like text, images, buttons) from the left sidebar onto your page.
   - Layout: Arrange and style the elements to create the desired layout.
Step 4: Adding Workflows
1. Workflow Tab: Click on the “Workflow” tab to define the logic of your application.
   - Events: Add events that trigger workflows (e.g., a button click).
   - Actions: Define actions that should occur when the event is triggered (e.g., navigate to a new page, modify a database entry).
Step 5: Setting Up the Database
1. Data Tab: Click on the “Data” tab to create and manage your database.
   - Types: Define different data types (like user, product, order).
   - Fields: Add fields to your data types to store information.
Step 6: Testing Your Application
1. Preview: Use the “Preview” button at the top right of the editor to test your application in real-time. This will open a new tab where you can interact with your app and see how it behaves.
Step 7: Deploying Your Application
1. Deployment: When you’re ready to make your application live, click on the “Deploy” button.
   - Free Plan: You can deploy your app on Bubble’s free plan with a Bubble subdomain.
   - Custom Domain: If you have a paid plan, you can deploy your app to a custom domain.
