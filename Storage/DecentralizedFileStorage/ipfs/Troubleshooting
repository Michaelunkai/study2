Troubleshooting
Here are common issues and their solutions:

1. Daemon Fails to Start
Check Logs:

 
 
journalctl -u ipfs -f
Possible Causes:

Port conflicts: Ensure ports 4001, 5001, and 8080 are not in use.
Insufficient permissions: Ensure the user has read/write access to the IPFS repository.
2. Unable to Connect to Peers
Solutions:
Verify network connectivity.
Check firewall settings.
Ensure that other nodes are online and reachable.
3. High Resource Usage
Solutions:
Limit the number of connections:

 
 
ipfs config --json Swarm.ConnMgr.HighWater 100
Optimize the repository size by pruning:

 
 
ipfs repo gc
4. Files Not Being Retrieved
Solutions:
Ensure the file is pinned or cached on enough nodes.
Verify the CID is correct.
Check your network connection.
