OpenDJ:
OpenDJ is an open-source directory service based on LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol), developed by ForgeRock. It is a directory server implementation used to store, organize, and retrieve information about users, devices, and other entities in a network. OpenDJ is optimized for scalability, performance, and reliability, making it suitable for identity management and directory-based applications.

Key Features:

LDAP Server: Implements the LDAPv3 protocol for directory services.
Replication: Supports multi-master replication to ensure high availability and data consistency across multiple servers.
Access Control: Provides fine-grained access control policies for managing read/write operations.
Schema Management: Allows customization of the schema to define attributes and object classes.
Scalability: Optimized for large-scale deployments with millions of directory entries.
Both OpenAM and OpenDJ are components of ForgeRock's identity platform, commonly used together in identity management solutions where OpenDJ acts as the LDAP directory for storing user information, and OpenAM handles access management and authentication.
