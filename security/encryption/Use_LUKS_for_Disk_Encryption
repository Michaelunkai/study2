Use LUKS for Disk Encryption
Encrypt your entire disk with LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup). This is best done during installation, but you can also encrypt additional partitions:

Install LUKS:

sudo apt install cryptsetup
Encrypt the partition:

sudo cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdX
sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdX my_encrypted_partition
Create a filesystem:

sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/my_encrypted_partition
Mount the encrypted partition:

sudo mount /dev/mapper/my_encrypted_partition /mnt
