Deploy a Simple Application
Create a deployment to ensure everything works. For example, to deploy an NGINX web server:

 
 
sudo k0s kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx
Expose the NGINX deployment as a service:

 
 
sudo k0s kubectl expose deployment nginx --port=80 --type=NodePort
To check if the service is running:

 
 
sudo k0s kubectl get services
Access the service using the node IP and the exposed port. You can find the port using the kubectl get services command.
