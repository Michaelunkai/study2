Open "Server Manager" and click on "Add roles and features."
Select "Active Directory Domain Services" and follow the wizard to install the role.
After installing the role, promote the server to a domain controller using the "Active Directory Domain Services Configuration Wizard" or "dcpromo" command.
Follow the prompts to configure the domain settings and complete the promotion process.
After completing this step, your Windows Server will be configured as a domain controller running Active Directory Domain Services, allowing you to centrally manage network resources and user accounts within your domain.
