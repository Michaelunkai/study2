Download the Site Content:
Open another terminal window and use wget to download the site content. Replace localhost:8000 with the appropriate address if different:

 
 
wget --mirror --convert-links --adjust-extension --page-requisites --no-parent http://localhost:8000
This will create a directory named localhost:8000 with your site content. Move this content to a directory named public:

 
 
mv localhost\:8000 public
