## Hosting Your Python Bottle App on Netlify Using the Command Line

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Node.js and npm**: Netlify CLI requires Node.js. You can download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Netlify CLI**: Install the Netlify CLI globally using npm:
     
   npm install -g netlify-cli

3. **Create a Netlify Account**: If you don't have a Netlify account, create one at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

### Steps to Host Your Python Bottle App on Netlify

1. **Login to Netlify**:
     
   netlify login

2. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**:
     
   cd /mnt/c/backup/windowsapps/installed/myapps/compiled_ /speach2text/bottle

3. **Create a Static Build**:
   Since Netlify is optimized for static sites, you'll need to create a static build of your Bottle app. You can use `gunicorn` to serve your Bottle app and `wget` to download the site content.

   First, install `gunicorn` if you haven't already:
     
   pip install gunicorn

   Create a script to start your Bottle app using `gunicorn`. Create a file named `serve.sh` with the following content:
     
   #!/bin/ 
   gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:8000 lambda_function:app

   Make it executable:
     
   chmod +x serve. 

   Start your Bottle app:
     
   ./serve. 

4. **Download the Site Content**:
   Open another terminal window and use `wget` to download the site content. Replace `localhost:8000` with the appropriate address if different:
     
   wget --mirror --convert-links --adjust-extension --page-requisites --no-parent http://localhost:8000

   This will create a directory named `localhost:8000` with your site content. Move this content to a directory named `public`:
     
   mv localhost\:8000 public

5. **Deploy to Netlify**:
     
   netlify deploy --dir=public --prod

   Follow the prompts to select your site name or create a new site.

After following these steps, your Bottle app should be hosted on Netlify.
