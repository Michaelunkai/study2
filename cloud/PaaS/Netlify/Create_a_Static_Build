Create a Static Build:
Since Netlify is optimized for static sites, you'll need to create a static build of your Bottle app. You can use gunicorn to serve your Bottle app and wget to download the site content.

First, install gunicorn if you haven't already:

 
 
pip install gunicorn
Create a script to start your Bottle app using gunicorn. Create a file named serve.sh with the following content:

 
 
#!/bin/ 
gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:8000 lambda_function:app
Make it executable:

 
 
chmod +x serve. 
Start your Bottle app:

 
 
./serve.
