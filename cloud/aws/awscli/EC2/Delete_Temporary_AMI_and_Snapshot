Delete the Temporary AMI and Snapshot Using AWS CLI
After the new instance is up and running, and the old instance is terminated, delete the temporary AMI (ami-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx) and its associated snapshot to avoid extra storage costs:

Deregister the AMI:

 
 
aws ec2 deregister-image --image-id ami-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Delete the associated snapshot:
First, find the snapshot ID associated with the AMI using the following command:

 
 
aws ec2 describe-images --image-ids ami-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx --query 'Images[0].BlockDeviceMappings[0].Ebs.SnapshotId' --output text
Then delete the snapshot:

 
 
aws ec2 delete-snapshot --snapshot-id snap-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Replace snap-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx with the snapshot ID obtained from the previous command.
