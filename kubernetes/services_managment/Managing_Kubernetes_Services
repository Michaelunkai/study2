6.1 Exposing Services:

Expose the nginx deployment as a Kubernetes service:

kubectl expose deployment nginx-deployment --type=LoadBalancer --port=80 --target-port=80

This command creates a service with type LoadBalancer, making the nginx deployment accessible from outside the cluster.

6.2 Viewing Services:

View the services in the Kubernetes cluster:


kubectl get services

This command lists all services, including the newly created nginx service.
